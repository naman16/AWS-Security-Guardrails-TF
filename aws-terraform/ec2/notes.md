# AWS EC2 Security Requirements Implementation Notes

1. EC2:001: Disable public IP addresses for EC2 instances
   - Implemented in Terraform code by setting `associate_public_ip_address = false` in the `aws_instance` resource.

2. EC2:002: Enable encryption for EBS volumes
   - Implemented in Terraform code by setting `encrypted = true` and providing a `kms_key_id` in the `root_block_device` block of the `aws_instance` resource.
   - Also implemented using `aws_ebs_encryption_by_default` resource to enable encryption by default for all new EBS volumes.

3. EC2:003: Attach IAM roles to EC2 instances
   - Implemented in Terraform code by setting `iam_instance_profile` in the `aws_instance` resource.

4. EC2:004: Enforce the use of IMDSv2 on EC2 instances
   - Implemented in Terraform code using the `metadata_options` block in the `aws_instance` resource, setting `http_tokens = "required"`.

5. EC2:005: Remove sensitive information from EC2 user data
   - Not directly implemented in Terraform. This is a best practice that should be followed when providing user data.

6. EC2:006: Enable detailed monitoring for EC2 instances
   - Implemented in Terraform code by setting `monitoring = true` in the `aws_instance` resource.

7. EC2:007: Use EBS-optimized instances
   - Implemented in Terraform code by setting `ebs_optimized = true` in the `aws_instance` resource.

8. EC2:008: Restrict security group ingress rules
   - Implemented in Terraform code using the `aws_security_group_rule` resource to define ingress rules.

9. EC2:009: Use VPC endpoints for AWS service access
   - Not implemented in this module. VPC endpoints should be managed separately.

10. EC2:010: Enable termination protection for critical EC2 instances
    - Implemented in Terraform code by setting `disable_api_termination = var.enable_termination_protection` in the `aws_instance` resource.

11. EC2:011: Use latest generation instance types
    - Implemented by setting a default value of "t3.micro" for the `instance_type` variable. Users should be encouraged to use the latest generation instance types.

12. EC2:012: Implement EC2 instance patching using AWS Systems Manager
    - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_ssm_patch_baseline`, `aws_ssm_patch_group`, `aws_ssm_maintenance_window`, `aws_ssm_maintenance_window_target`, and `aws_ssm_maintenance_window_task` resources.

13. EC2:013: Enable EBS snapshot encryption
    - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_ebs_encryption_by_default` resource to enable encryption by default for all new EBS volumes and snapshots.

14. EC2:014: Implement EC2 instance isolation using dedicated hosts or instances
    - Implemented in Terraform code by setting `tenancy = var.use_dedicated_instance ? "dedicated" : "default"` in the `aws_instance` resource.

15. EC2:015: Enable VPC flow logs
    - Implemented in Terraform code using the `aws_flow_log` resource.

Additional security measures and best practices:
- All configurable parameters are exposed as variables to make the module reusable and flexible.
- The module uses secure options by default, such as enabling encryption, disabling public IP addresses, and enforcing IMDSv2.
- The module assumes that KMS keys, IAM roles, and other supporting resources already exist and requires their IDs/ARNs as input.
- Consider implementing additional access controls and monitoring for the EC2 instances and associated resources.
- Implement least privilege access principles when defining IAM policies for EC2 instance roles.
- Regularly review and audit security group rules, IAM roles, and instance configurations to ensure compliance with security requirements.
- Use the latest AMIs and keep instances updated with security patches.
- Consider implementing additional security measures such as AWS Config rules or custom scripts to enforce and monitor security best practices.
