# AWS ECS Security Requirements Implementation Notes

1. ECS:001 - Avoid storing secrets in ECS task definition environment variables
   - Implemented in Terraform code by not including any environment variables in the task definition. Secrets should be managed using AWS Secrets Manager or Systems Manager Parameter Store.

2. ECS:002 - Configure secure networking modes and user definitions for ECS task definitions
   - Partially implemented in Terraform code by using "awsvpc" network mode. User definitions should be handled in the Docker image or through additional container definitions.

3. ECS:003 - Disable automatic public IP assignment for ECS services
   - Implemented in Terraform code by setting `assign_public_ip = false` in the `network_configuration` block of `aws_ecs_service` resource.

4. ECS:004 - Prevent the use of privileged containers in ECS task definitions
   - Implemented in Terraform code by setting `privileged = false` in the container definition.

5. ECS:005 - Enable Container Insights for ECS clusters
   - Implemented in Terraform code by enabling Container Insights in the `aws_ecs_cluster` resource.

6. ECS:006 - Enforce read-only root filesystem for ECS containers
   - Implemented in Terraform code by setting `readonlyRootFilesystem = true` in the container definition.

7. ECS:007 - Prevent ECS task definitions from sharing the host's process namespace
   - Implemented in Terraform code by setting `pid_mode = "task"` in the container definition.

8. ECS:008 - Implement logging configuration for ECS task definition containers
   - Implemented in Terraform code by configuring the `logConfiguration` in the container definition.

9. ECS:009 - Use the latest Fargate platform version for ECS Fargate services
   - Implemented in Terraform code by setting `platform_version = "LATEST"` in the `aws_ecs_service` resource.

10. ECS:010 - Enable ECS Exec logging
    - Implemented in Terraform code using the `aws_ecs_cluster_configuration` resource with logging enabled.

11. ECS:011 - Use AWS KMS Customer Managed Keys for ECS Exec logging encryption
    - Implemented in Terraform code by enabling encryption and specifying a KMS key in the `aws_ecs_cluster_configuration` resource.

12. ECS:012 - Enable encryption in transit for EFS volumes in ECS task definitions
    - Implemented in Terraform code by configuring EFS volumes with `transit_encryption = "ENABLED"` in the task definition.

13. ECS:013 - Use separate IAM roles for ECS task execution and task functionality
    - Implemented in Terraform code by specifying separate `execution_role_arn` and `task_role_arn` in the `aws_ecs_task_definition` resource.

14. ECS:014 - Implement VPC endpoints for ECS and ECR
    - Not implemented in this Terraform module. VPC endpoints should be managed separately in the VPC configuration.

15. ECS:015 - Implement ECS task networking using awsvpc network mode
    - Implemented in Terraform code by setting `network_mode = "awsvpc"` in the `aws_ecs_task_definition` resource.

Additional security measures and best practices:
- All configurable parameters are exposed as variables to make the module reusable and flexible.
- The module uses secure defaults where possible, such as disabling privileged mode and enforcing read-only root filesystems.
- The module assumes that IAM roles, KMS keys, and other supporting resources already exist and requires their IDs/ARNs as input.
- Consider implementing additional monitoring and alerting for ECS tasks and services.
- Regularly update task definitions to use the latest secure container images.
- Implement least privilege access principles when defining IAM roles for tasks and services.
- Regularly review and audit ECS configurations and logs to ensure compliance with security requirements.
