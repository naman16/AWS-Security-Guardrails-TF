# AWS Kinesis Security Requirements Implementation Notes

1. kinesis:001: Use AWS KMS Customer Managed Key (CMK) for Kinesis Stream Encryption
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `encryption_type` and `kms_key_id` in the `aws_kinesis_stream` resource.

2. kinesis:002: Enable Enhanced Fan-Out for Kinesis Data Streams Consumers
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_kinesis_stream_consumer` resource.

3. kinesis:003: Implement Least Privilege Access for Kinesis Streams
   - Partially implemented in Terraform code by creating separate read and write IAM policies for Kinesis streams.

4. kinesis:004: Enable Server-Side Encryption for Kinesis Firehose Delivery Streams
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `server_side_encryption` block in the `aws_kinesis_firehose_delivery_stream` resource.

5. kinesis:005: Configure Secure VPC Endpoints for Kinesis Streams
   - Not implemented in this module. VPC endpoints should be managed separately.

6. kinesis:006: Implement Monitoring and Alerting for Kinesis Streams
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_cloudwatch_metric_alarm` resource to monitor error rates.

7. kinesis:007: Enable Enhanced Monitoring for Kinesis Data Streams
   - Implemented in Terraform code by setting `stream_mode = "ON_DEMAND"` in the `aws_kinesis_stream` resource.

8. kinesis:008: Implement Secure Data Retention for Kinesis Streams
   - Implemented in Terraform code by setting `retention_period` in the `aws_kinesis_stream` resource.

9. kinesis:009: Use Latest AWS SDK Version for Kinesis Client Applications
   - Not directly implementable in Terraform. This is a recommendation for application development.

10. kinesis:010: Implement Secure Key Management for Kinesis Producer Library (KPL)
    - Not directly implementable in Terraform. This is a recommendation for application development and operations.

Additional security measures and best practices:
- All configurable parameters are exposed as variables to make the module reusable and flexible.
- The module uses secure options by default, such as enabling encryption and setting retention periods.
- The module assumes that KMS keys and SNS topics already exist and requires their ARNs as input.
- Consider implementing additional monitoring and alerting for other Kinesis metrics.
- Regularly review and audit Kinesis stream configurations and access patterns to ensure compliance with security requirements.
- Implement proper error handling and retry mechanisms in Kinesis client applications.
- Ensure that the AWS SDK is kept up-to-date in all client applications interacting with Kinesis streams.
- Implement proper secret management for Kinesis Producer Library credentials using AWS Secrets Manager or Systems Manager Parameter Store.
