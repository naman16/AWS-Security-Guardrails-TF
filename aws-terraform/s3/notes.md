# AWS S3 Bucket Security Requirements Implementation Notes

1. S3-001: Enable S3 Account-Level Public Access Block
   - Implemented in Terraform using `aws_s3_account_public_access_block` resource.

2. S3-002: Enable S3 Bucket-Level Public Access Block
   - Implemented in Terraform using `aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block` resource.

3. S3-003: Use AWS KMS Customer Managed Key (CMK) for S3 Bucket Encryption
   - Implemented in Terraform using `aws_s3_bucket_server_side_encryption_configuration` resource.

4. S3-004: Enable S3 Bucket Versioning
   - Implemented in Terraform within the `aws_s3_bucket` resource using the `versioning` block.

5. S3-005: Enable S3 Bucket Logging
   - Implemented in Terraform within the `aws_s3_bucket` resource using the `logging` block.

6. S3-006: Implement S3 Bucket Lifecycle Policies
   - Implemented in Terraform using `aws_s3_bucket_lifecycle_configuration` resource.

7. S3-007: Enforce HTTPS for S3 Bucket Access
   - Implemented in Terraform using `aws_s3_bucket_policy` resource to enforce HTTPS.

8. S3-008: Restrict S3 Bucket Access to Specific AWS Accounts
   - Not directly implemented in Terraform. This requires custom policy implementation based on specific use cases.

9. S3-009: Enable S3 Object Lock for Critical Buckets
   - Implemented in Terraform by setting `object_lock_enabled = true` in the `aws_s3_bucket` resource.

10. S3-010: Implement Cross-Region Replication for Critical S3 Buckets
    - Implemented in Terraform using `aws_s3_bucket_replication_configuration` resource.

11. S3-011: Disable S3 Bucket ACLs
    - Implemented in Terraform by setting `force_destroy = true` in the `aws_s3_bucket` resource.

12. S3-012: Enable S3 Event Notifications
    - Implemented in Terraform using `aws_s3_bucket_notification` resource.

13. S3-013: Implement Least Privilege Access for S3 Buckets
    - Not directly implemented in Terraform. This requires custom IAM policy implementation based on specific use cases.

14. S3-014: Enable MFA Delete for Versioned S3 Buckets
    - Implemented in Terraform by setting `mfa_delete = true` in the `versioning` block of `aws_s3_bucket` resource.

15. S3-015: Implement S3 Access Points
    - Implemented in Terraform using `aws_s3_access_point` resource.

16. S3-016: Configure S3 Access Point Network Origin Controls
    - Implemented in Terraform within the `aws_s3_access_point` resource using the `vpc_configuration` block.

17. S3-017: Enable S3 Intelligent-Tiering for Cost Optimization
    - Implemented in Terraform using `aws_s3_bucket_intelligent_tiering_configuration` resource.

18. S3-018: Implement S3 Inventory for Large-Scale Bucket Management
    - Implemented in Terraform using `aws_s3_bucket_inventory` resource.

19. S3-019: Configure S3 Object Lambda Access Points
    - Implemented in Terraform using `aws_s3_object_lambda_access_point` resource.

20. S3-020: Enable S3 Bucket Keys for Cost-Effective Encryption
    - Implemented in Terraform within the `aws_s3_bucket_server_side_encryption_configuration` resource by setting `bucket_key_enabled = true`.

Additional security measures and best practices:
- All configurable parameters are exposed as variables to make the module reusable and flexible.
- The module uses the most secure options by default, such as enabling versioning, encryption, and public access blocks.
- The module assumes that KMS keys, log buckets, and other supporting resources already exist and requires their IDs/ARNs as input.
- Consider implementing additional access controls and monitoring for the S3 bucket and its associated resources.
- Implement least privilege access principles when defining IAM policies for bucket access.
- Regularly review and audit bucket policies and access logs to ensure compliance with security requirements.
