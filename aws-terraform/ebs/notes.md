# AWS EBS Security Requirements Implementation Notes

1. EBS-001: Enable EBS default encryption using AWS KMS Customer Managed Key (CMK)
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_ebs_encryption_by_default` and `aws_ebs_default_kms_key` resources.

2. EBS-002: Encrypt EBS snapshots using AWS KMS Customer Managed Key (CMK)
   - Inherently implemented by enabling default encryption (EBS-001). All new snapshots will be encrypted.

3. EBS-003: Encrypt all existing EBS volumes using AWS KMS Customer Managed Key (CMK)
   - Partially implemented through default encryption (EBS-001). Existing volumes will need to be manually encrypted or replaced.

4. EBS-004: Implement IAM policies for EBS volume and snapshot management
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_iam_policy` resources for read and write access.

5. EBS-005: Enable EBS volume termination protection
   - Not directly implemented in Terraform. This setting is applied at the EC2 instance level when attaching the volume.

6. EBS-006: Implement regular backups of EBS volumes
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_backup_plan` and `aws_backup_selection` resources.

7. EBS-007: Monitor EBS volume performance and usage
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_cloudwatch_metric_alarm` resource for monitoring queue length.

8. EBS-008: Implement lifecycle policies for EBS snapshots
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_dlm_lifecycle_policy` resource.

9. EBS-009: Use EBS encryption with supported EC2 instance types
   - Inherently implemented by enabling default encryption (EBS-001). Instance type selection is done at EC2 level.

10. EBS-010: Implement cross-region replication for critical EBS snapshots
    - Not directly implemented in Terraform. Requires custom scripts or manual implementation.

Additional security measures and best practices:
- All configurable parameters are exposed as variables to make the module reusable and flexible.
- The module uses the most secure options by default, such as enabling encryption and setting up monitoring.
- The module assumes that KMS keys, IAM roles, and SNS topics already exist and requires their ARNs as input.
- Consider implementing additional access controls and monitoring for EBS volumes and snapshots.
- Implement least privilege access principles when defining IAM policies for EBS management.
- Regularly review and audit EBS volume and snapshot configurations to ensure compliance with security requirements.
- For EBS-003, consider creating a process to identify and encrypt existing unencrypted volumes.
- For EBS-005, ensure that termination protection is enabled when attaching volumes to EC2 instances.
- For EBS-010, consider implementing a custom solution for cross-region snapshot replication for critical data.
