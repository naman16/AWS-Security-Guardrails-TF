# AWS DataSync Security Requirements Implementation Notes

1. datasync:001: Enable CloudWatch Logging for DataSync Tasks
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `cloudwatch_log_group_arn` in the `aws_datasync_task` resource.

2. datasync:002: Use AWS KMS Customer Managed Key for DataSync Encryption
   - Partially implemented. DataSync uses AWS-managed keys by default. For customer-managed keys, additional configuration may be required depending on the source and destination types.

3. datasync:003: Restrict DataSync Task Access to Specific VPC Endpoints
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `source_network_interface_arns` and `destination_network_interface_arns` in the `aws_datasync_task` resource.

4. datasync:004: Implement Least Privilege Access for DataSync Tasks
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_iam_role` and `aws_iam_role_policy` resources with minimal required permissions.

5. datasync:005: Enable Integrity Verification for DataSync Transfers
   - Implemented in Terraform code by setting `verify_mode = "POINT_IN_TIME_CONSISTENT"` in the `aws_datasync_task` resource.

6. datasync:006: Use HTTPS for DataSync Connections
   - This is enforced by default in AWS DataSync and doesn't require explicit configuration in Terraform.

7. datasync:007: Implement Task-Level Filters for DataSync
   - Implemented in Terraform code using the `includes` block in the `aws_datasync_task` resource.

8. datasync:008: Enable AWS CloudTrail for DataSync API Activity Monitoring
   - Not directly implementable in this module. CloudTrail should be configured at the account level.

9. datasync:009: Implement Regular Review of DataSync Task Configurations
   - Not directly implementable in Terraform. This is an operational process that should be implemented outside of infrastructure-as-code.

10. datasync:010: Use Secure Authentication Methods for DataSync Tasks
    - Implemented by using IAM roles for authentication, which is the default and most secure method for AWS services.

Additional security measures and best practices:
- All configurable parameters are exposed as variables to make the module reusable and flexible.
- The module uses secure options by default, such as enabling integrity verification and task queueing.
- Consider implementing additional monitoring and alerting for DataSync tasks using CloudWatch alarms.
- Regularly review and audit DataSync task configurations and access logs to ensure compliance with security requirements.
- Implement network security controls (e.g., security groups, NACLs) for the VPC endpoints used by DataSync tasks.
- Ensure that the source and destination locations for DataSync tasks are properly secured and follow the principle of least privilege.
