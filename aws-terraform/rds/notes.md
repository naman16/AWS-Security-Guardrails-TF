# AWS RDS Security Requirements Implementation Notes

   - Implemented in Terraform code using `multi_az = var.multi_az` in the `aws_db_instance` resource.

2. rds:002: Use Supported and Up-to-Date RDS Engine Versions
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `engine` and `engine_version` variables in the `aws_db_instance` resource.

3. rds:003: Enable Event Subscriptions for RDS Parameter Groups
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_db_event_subscription` resource.

4. rds:004: Enable Automatic Minor Version Upgrades for RDS Instances and Clusters
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `auto_minor_version_upgrade = var.auto_minor_version_upgrade` in the `aws_db_instance` resource.

5. rds:005: Enable CloudWatch Logs Integration for RDS Instances and Clusters
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `enabled_cloudwatch_logs_exports` in the `aws_db_instance` resource.

6. rds:006: Enable Encryption at Rest for RDS Instances and Clusters
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `storage_encrypted = true` and `kms_key_id = var.kms_key_id` in the `aws_db_instance` resource.

7. rds:007: Enable Copy Tags to Snapshots for RDS Instances and Clusters
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `copy_tags_to_snapshot = true` in the `aws_db_instance` resource.

8. rds:008: Use Non-Default Master Username for RDS Instances and Clusters
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `username = var.master_username` in the `aws_db_instance` resource.

9. rds:009: Enable IAM Database Authentication for RDS Instances and Clusters
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `iam_database_authentication_enabled = var.iam_database_authentication_enabled` in the `aws_db_instance` resource.

10. rds:010: Enable Backtrack for Aurora MySQL Clusters
    - Not implemented as this module focuses on RDS instances, not Aurora clusters.

11. rds:011: Enable Event Subscriptions for RDS Instances
    - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_db_event_subscription` resource.

12. rds:012: Enable Enhanced Monitoring for RDS Instances
    - Implemented in Terraform code using `monitoring_interval` and `monitoring_role_arn` in the `aws_db_instance` resource.

13. rds:013: Deploy RDS Instances within a VPC
    - Implemented in Terraform code using `db_subnet_group_name` and `vpc_security_group_ids` in the `aws_db_instance` resource.

14. rds:014: Enable Deletion Protection for RDS Instances and Clusters
    - Implemented in Terraform code using `deletion_protection = true` in the `aws_db_instance` resource.

15. rds:015: Ensure RDS Snapshots and Cluster Snapshots are Not Public
    - Not directly implemented in Terraform. This is a default setting for RDS snapshots and should be managed through separate snapshot resources if needed.

16. rds:016: Use Up-to-Date SSL/TLS Certificates for RDS Instances
    - Implemented in Terraform code using `ca_cert_identifier` in the `aws_db_instance` resource.

17. rds:017: Use Non-Default Ports for RDS Instances and Clusters
    - Implemented in Terraform code using `port` in the `aws_db_instance` resource.

18. rds:018: Enable Automatic Backups for RDS Instances
    - Implemented in Terraform code using `backup_retention_period` in the `aws_db_instance` resource.

19. rds:019: Enable Encryption in Transit for RDS Instances
    - Implemented in Terraform code using `rds.force_ssl = 1` parameter in the `aws_db_parameter_group` resource.

20. rds:020: Enable Performance Insights with KMS Encryption for RDS Instances
    - Implemented in Terraform code using `performance_insights_enabled`, `performance_insights_kms_key_id`, and `performance_insights_retention_period` in the `aws_db_instance` resource.

21. rds:021: Implement AWS Backup Plans for RDS Instances and Clusters
    - Not implemented in this module. AWS Backup plans should be managed separately.

22. rds:022: Enable Query Logging for PostgreSQL RDS Instances and Clusters
    - Implemented in Terraform code using a dynamic parameter block in the `aws_db_parameter_group` resource for PostgreSQL engines.

23. rds:023: Enable Audit Logging for MySQL RDS Instances and Aurora MySQL Clusters
    - Implemented in Terraform code using a dynamic parameter block in the `aws_db_parameter_group` resource for MySQL engines.

24. rds:024: Use KMS Customer Managed Keys for RDS Cluster Activity Streams
    - Not implemented as this module focuses on RDS instances, not Aurora clusters.

25. rds:025: Enable Encryption for RDS Global Clusters
    - Not implemented as this module focuses on RDS instances, not global clusters.

Additional security measures and best practices:
- All configurable parameters are exposed as variables to make the module reusable and flexible.
- The module uses the most secure options by default, such as enabling encryption, multi-AZ deployment, and deletion protection.
- The module assumes that KMS keys, IAM roles, and VPC resources already exist and requires their IDs/ARNs as input.
- Implemented IAM policies for read-only and write access to the RDS instance.
- Disabled public accessibility by default for better security.
- Enabled final snapshot creation by default to ensure data preservation.
- Consider implementing additional monitoring and alerting for the RDS instance using CloudWatch alarms.
- Regularly review and update the engine versions, parameter groups, and security settings to maintain the highest level of security.
