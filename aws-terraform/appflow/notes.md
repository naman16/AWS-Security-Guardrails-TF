# AWS AppFlow Security Requirements Implementation Notes

1. appflow:001: Use AWS KMS Customer Managed Key (CMK) for AppFlow Connector Profile Encryption
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_appflow_connector_profile` resource with `kms_arn` attribute.

2. appflow:002: Use AWS KMS Customer Managed Key (CMK) for AppFlow Flow Encryption
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_appflow_flow` resource with `kms_arn` attribute.

3. appflow:003: Enable Encryption in Transit for AppFlow Flows
   - Partially implemented. AppFlow uses TLS 1.2 by default for data in transit. No specific Terraform configuration required.

4. appflow:004: Implement Least Privilege Access for AppFlow Flows
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_iam_role` and `aws_iam_role_policy` resources with least privilege permissions.

5. appflow:005: Enable AppFlow Flow Logging
   - Implemented in Terraform code within the `aws_appflow_flow` resource using the `log_config` block.

6. appflow:006: Configure AppFlow Flow Failure Handling
   - Implemented in Terraform code within the `aws_appflow_flow` resource using the `error_handling_config` block.

7. appflow:007: Implement Data Validation for AppFlow Flows
   - Partially implemented in Terraform code within the `aws_appflow_flow` resource using the `connector_operator` block. Specific validation rules need to be added based on use case.

8. appflow:008: Use Private Connectivity for AppFlow Flows
   - Partially implemented by setting `connection_mode = "Private"` in the `aws_appflow_connector_profile` resource. Additional VPC endpoint configuration may be required outside this module.

9. appflow:009: Implement Regular Review of AppFlow Flow Configurations
   - Cannot be directly implemented in Terraform. This is an operational process that should be established outside of infrastructure code.

10. appflow:010: Enable AppFlow Tags for Resource Management
    - Implemented in Terraform code by adding `tags` attribute to the `aws_appflow_flow` resource.

Additional security measures and best practices:
- All configurable parameters are exposed as variables to make the module reusable and flexible.
- The module uses secure options by default, such as enabling encryption and logging.
- The module assumes that KMS keys and log streams already exist and requires their ARNs as input.
- Consider implementing additional monitoring and alerting for AppFlow flows and their associated resources.
- Regularly review and audit flow configurations and access logs to ensure compliance with security requirements.
- Implement proper error handling and notification mechanisms for flow failures.
- Ensure that data validation rules are properly configured based on specific use cases.
- Regularly update the IAM policies to maintain least privilege access as AppFlow requirements change.
