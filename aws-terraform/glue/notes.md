# AWS Glue Security Requirements Implementation Notes

1. glue:001: Enable encryption at rest for AWS Glue ETL jobs
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_glue_security_configuration` resource with encryption settings for S3, CloudWatch, and job bookmarks.

2. glue:002: Enable encryption at rest for AWS Glue development endpoints
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_glue_dev_endpoint` resource with the security configuration.

3. glue:003: Enable metadata encryption for AWS Glue Data Catalog
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_glue_data_catalog_encryption_settings` resource.

4. glue:004: Enable password encryption for AWS Glue Data Catalog connections
   - Implemented as part of the `aws_glue_data_catalog_encryption_settings` resource.

5. glue:005: Enable encryption at rest for AWS Glue Machine Learning transforms
   - Implemented as part of the `aws_glue_security_configuration` resource, which is applied to all Glue components including ML transforms.

6. glue:006: Enable encryption for AWS Glue development endpoints CloudWatch logs
   - Implemented in Terraform code by setting CloudWatch logs encryption in the `aws_glue_security_configuration` resource.

7. glue:007: Enable SSL for AWS Glue database connections
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_glue_connection` resource with SSL match criteria.

8. glue:008: Enable encryption for AWS Glue ETL jobs CloudWatch logs
   - Implemented as part of the `aws_glue_security_configuration` resource, which is applied to all Glue components including ETL jobs.

9. glue:009: Restrict public access to AWS Glue Data Catalogs
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_glue_resource_policy` resource to restrict access to specific principals.

10. glue:010: Associate security configurations with AWS Glue components
    - Implemented by applying the created security configuration to the Glue job and development endpoint.

11. glue:011: Implement least privilege access for AWS Glue resources
    - Partially implemented by creating separate read-only and write IAM policies for Glue resources. Full implementation requires careful assignment of these policies to specific IAM roles or users based on their needs.

12. glue:012: Enable AWS Glue job bookmarks
    - Implemented in Terraform code by setting the "--job-bookmark-option" in the Glue job configuration.

13. glue:013: Use VPC for AWS Glue jobs and development endpoints
    - Implemented by specifying VPC configuration (subnet and security groups) for the development endpoint and connecting the Glue job to a VPC-enabled connection.

14. glue:014: Enable monitoring for AWS Glue jobs
    - Implemented in Terraform code by enabling various monitoring options in the Glue job configuration, including CloudWatch logs, metrics, and Spark UI.

15. glue:015: Implement proper error handling and logging for AWS Glue jobs
    - Partially implemented by enabling continuous CloudWatch logging and setting up job notifications. Full implementation requires proper error handling in the actual Glue job script, which is outside the scope of this Terraform configuration.

Additional security measures and best practices:
- All configurable parameters are exposed as variables to make the module reusable and flexible.
- The module uses secure options by default, such as enabling encryption for all components.
- The module assumes that KMS keys, VPC resources, and log groups already exist and requires their IDs/ARNs as input.
- Consider implementing additional monitoring and alerting for Glue jobs and data catalog activities.
- Regularly review and audit Glue configurations, access patterns, and logs to ensure compliance with security requirements.
- Implement proper secret management for sensitive information like database passwords.
- Consider using AWS Secrets Manager for managing sensitive connection information.
- Regularly update Glue version and Python version to benefit from the latest security patches and features.
