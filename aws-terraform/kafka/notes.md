# AWS MSK Cluster Security Requirements Implementation Notes

1. kafka:001: Use private subnets for MSK cluster deployment
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `private_subnet_ids` in the `aws_msk_cluster` resource.

2. kafka:002: Enable mutual TLS authentication for MSK cluster
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `client_authentication` block with TLS configuration in the `aws_msk_cluster` resource.

3. kafka:003: Disable unauthenticated access for MSK cluster
   - Implemented in Terraform code by enabling TLS and SASL authentication in the `client_authentication` block of the `aws_msk_cluster` resource.

4. kafka:004: Enable enhanced monitoring for MSK brokers
   - Implemented in Terraform code by setting `enhanced_monitoring = "PER_BROKER"` in the `aws_msk_cluster` resource.

5. kafka:005: Use AWS KMS Customer Managed Key for MSK cluster encryption at rest
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `encryption_info` block with `encryption_at_rest_kms_key_arn` in the `aws_msk_cluster` resource.

6. kafka:006: Use the latest supported Apache Kafka version for MSK cluster
   - Implemented in Terraform code by setting `kafka_version` variable with a default value of the latest stable version.

7. kafka:007: Enable encryption in transit for MSK cluster
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `encryption_info` block with `encryption_in_transit` configuration in the `aws_msk_cluster` resource.

8. kafka:008: Implement fine-grained access control for MSK cluster
   - Partially implemented in Terraform code using `aws_msk_scram_secret_association` resource for SASL/SCRAM authentication.
   - Additional IAM policies may be required for fine-grained access control, which should be implemented separately.

9. kafka:009: Configure secure client authentication for MSK cluster
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `client_authentication` block with TLS and SASL configurations in the `aws_msk_cluster` resource.

10. kafka:010: Enable automatic minor version upgrades for MSK cluster
    - Implemented in Terraform code using `configuration_info` block in the `aws_msk_cluster` resource and `aws_msk_configuration` resource.

11. kafka:011: Implement multi-AZ deployment for MSK cluster
    - Implemented in Terraform code by setting `number_of_broker_nodes = 3` (default) and using multiple private subnets across AZs.

12. kafka:012: Configure MSK cluster logging
    - Implemented in Terraform code using `logging_info` block in the `aws_msk_cluster` resource, configuring both CloudWatch Logs and S3 logging.

13. kafka:013: Implement MSK cluster monitoring using Amazon CloudWatch
    - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_cloudwatch_metric_alarm` resource to monitor CPU utilization.

14. kafka:014: Use VPC peering or AWS Transit Gateway for secure MSK cluster access
    - Not directly implemented in Terraform. This requires separate VPC peering or Transit Gateway configuration, which should be done at the network level.

15. kafka:015: Implement proper topic and partition management for MSK cluster
    - Partially implemented in Terraform code using `aws_msk_cluster_policy` resource to set up topic-level access control.
    - Additional topic and partition management practices should be implemented at the application level and through operational procedures.

Additional security measures and best practices:
- All configurable parameters are exposed as variables to make the module reusable and flexible.
- The module uses secure defaults, such as enabling encryption in transit and at rest.
- The module assumes that KMS keys, ACM certificates, and log destinations (CloudWatch Logs, S3) already exist and requires their ARNs/names as input.
- Consider implementing additional monitoring and alerting based on specific use cases and requirements.
- Regularly review and update the Kafka version to ensure the latest security patches are applied.
- Implement proper network segmentation and security group rules to control access to the MSK cluster.
- Use AWS IAM authentication for Kafka when possible, in addition to SASL/SCRAM.
- Regularly rotate credentials used for SASL/SCRAM authentication.
- Implement proper backup and disaster recovery procedures for the MSK cluster.
- Consider using AWS Private Link for secure access to the MSK cluster from other VPCs or on-premises networks.
