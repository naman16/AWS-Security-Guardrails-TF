# AWS Route 53 Security Requirements Implementation Notes

1. route53:001: Enable Query Logging for Route 53 Public Hosted Zones
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_route53_query_log` resource.

2. route53:002: Enable Transfer Lock for Route 53 Domains
   - Cannot be directly implemented in Terraform. This is managed at the domain registrar level.

3. route53:003: Enable Privacy Protection for Route 53 Domains
   - Cannot be directly implemented in Terraform. This is managed at the domain registrar level.

4. route53:004: Remove Dangling DNS Records in Route 53
   - Cannot be directly implemented in Terraform. This requires regular auditing and manual removal of outdated records.

5. route53:005: Enable DNSSEC Signing for Route 53 Public Hosted Zones
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_route53_key_signing_key` and `aws_route53_hosted_zone_dnssec` resources.

6. route53:006: Implement Least Privilege Access for Route 53 Management
   - Partially implemented by creating separate read-only and write IAM policies. Users should attach these policies as needed.

7. route53:007: Use AWS KMS Customer Managed Keys for DNSSEC Signing
   - Partially implemented by allowing users to provide a custom KMS key ARN for DNSSEC signing.

8. route53:008: Implement Monitoring for Critical DNS Changes
   - Cannot be directly implemented in Terraform. This requires setting up CloudWatch alarms, which should be done in a separate monitoring module.

9. route53:009: Use Private Hosted Zones for Internal DNS Resolution
   - Implemented in Terraform code by allowing the creation of private hosted zones with the `aws_route53_zone` resource.

10. route53:010: Implement Health Checks for DNS Failover
    - Implemented in Terraform code using the `aws_route53_health_check` resource.

Additional security measures and best practices:
- All configurable parameters are exposed as variables to make the module reusable and flexible.
- The module uses secure defaults where possible (e.g., query logging and DNSSEC are enabled by default).
- The module assumes that CloudWatch log groups and KMS keys already exist and requires their ARNs as input.
- Consider implementing additional monitoring and alerting for Route 53 changes and activities.
- Regularly review and audit DNS records and access logs to ensure compliance with security requirements.
- Implement proper change management processes for DNS changes.
- Consider using AWS Organizations and Service Control Policies (SCPs) for additional control over Route 53 usage across the organization.
