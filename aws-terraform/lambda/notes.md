# AWS Lambda Function Security Requirements Implementation Notes

1. lambda:001: Use AWS KMS Customer Managed Key (CMK) for Lambda Function Environment Variables Encryption
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `kms_key_arn` in the `aws_lambda_function` resource.

2. lambda:002: Enable Code Signing for Lambda Functions
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_lambda_code_signing_config` and `aws_lambda_function_code_signing_config` resources.

3. lambda:003: Use Only Supported and Non-Deprecated Lambda Function Runtimes
   - Implemented in Terraform code by setting the `runtime` attribute in the `aws_lambda_function` resource. The specific runtime is provided as a variable.

4. lambda:004: Implement Dead Letter Queues for Lambda Functions
   - Implemented in Terraform code using the `dead_letter_config` block in the `aws_lambda_function` resource.

5. lambda:005: Set Function-Level Concurrent Execution Limits for Lambda Functions
   - Implemented in Terraform code using the `reserved_concurrent_executions` attribute in the `aws_lambda_function` resource.

6. lambda:006: Deploy Lambda Functions Within a VPC
   - Implemented in Terraform code using the `vpc_config` block in the `aws_lambda_function` resource.

7. lambda:007: Enable X-Ray Tracing for Lambda Functions
   - Implemented in Terraform code using the `tracing_config` block in the `aws_lambda_function` resource.

8. lambda:008: Secure Lambda Function URLs with Authentication
   - Implemented in Terraform code using the `aws_lambda_function_url` resource with `authorization_type = "AWS_IAM"`.

9. lambda:009: Restrict Lambda Function Resource-Based Policies
   - Partially implemented in Terraform code using the `aws_lambda_permission` resource. Additional custom policies may be required based on specific use cases.

10. lambda:010: Use SourceArn or SourceAccount in Lambda Function Permissions for AWS Services
    - Implemented in Terraform code using the `source_arn` attribute in the `aws_lambda_permission` resource.

11. lambda:011: Deploy Lambda Functions Across Multiple Availability Zones
    - Implemented in Terraform code by providing multiple subnet IDs in different AZs for the `vpc_config` block of the `aws_lambda_function` resource.

12. lambda:012: Implement Least Privilege IAM Roles for Lambda Functions
    - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_iam_role`, `aws_iam_policy`, and `aws_iam_role_policy_attachment` resources with minimal permissions.

13. lambda:013: Enable Enhanced Monitoring for Lambda Functions
    - Enhanced monitoring is enabled by default when deploying Lambda functions in a VPC.

14. lambda:014: Implement Input Validation for Lambda Functions
    - Cannot be directly implemented in Terraform. This is a code-level implementation that should be done within the Lambda function itself.

15. lambda:015: Use AWS Secrets Manager for Storing Sensitive Information
    - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_secretsmanager_secret` and `aws_secretsmanager_secret_version` resources, with appropriate IAM permissions for the Lambda function to access secrets.

Additional security measures and best practices:
- All configurable parameters are exposed as variables to make the module reusable and flexible.
- The module uses secure options by default, such as IAM authentication for function URLs and enforcing code signing.
- The module assumes that KMS keys, VPC resources, and dead letter queues already exist and requires their IDs/ARNs as input.
- Consider implementing additional monitoring and alerting for the Lambda function using CloudWatch alarms.
- Regularly review and update the Lambda function's code, dependencies, and runtime to address potential vulnerabilities.
- Implement proper error handling and logging within the Lambda function code.
- Use version control and consider implementing a CI/CD pipeline for deploying Lambda functions securely.
