# AWS IAM Security Requirements Implementation Notes

1. IAM:001: Implement least privilege access for IAM policies
   - Not directly implemented in Terraform. This requires custom policy implementation based on specific use cases.

2. IAM:002: Configure strong IAM password policy
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_iam_account_password_policy` resource.

3. IAM:003: Enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all IAM users
   - Partially implemented in Terraform code by setting `password_reset_required = true` for user login profiles. Full MFA enforcement requires additional configuration and user action.

4. IAM:004: Restrict use of the AWS root account
   - Not directly implementable in Terraform. This is an operational practice that requires manual configuration and monitoring.

5. IAM:005: Use IAM roles for EC2 instances and AWS services
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_iam_role` resource with EC2 service as the principal.

6. IAM:006: Implement regular access key rotation
   - Not directly implementable in Terraform. This requires operational processes and can be assisted by AWS Config rules or custom scripts.

7. IAM:007: Use IAM groups for access management
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_iam_group` and `aws_iam_group_membership` resources.

8. IAM:008: Implement IAM access analyzer
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_accessanalyzer_analyzer` resource.

9. IAM:009: Use Service Control Policies (SCPs) for organizational control
   - Not implemented in this module. SCPs are typically managed at the AWS Organizations level and require separate configuration.

10. IAM:010: Implement and maintain IAM user access reviews
    - Not directly implementable in Terraform. This is an operational practice that requires regular manual or automated reviews.

11. IAM:011: Use IAM policy conditions for enhanced security
    - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_iam_policy` resource with condition blocks for IP restriction and MFA enforcement.

12. IAM:012: Implement cross-account access using IAM roles
    - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_iam_role` resource with cross-account trust relationship.

13. IAM:013: Use IAM policy simulator for testing
    - Not directly implementable in Terraform. This is a manual process using the AWS Management Console or API.

14. IAM:014: Implement IAM credential report monitoring
    - Implemented in Terraform code using CloudWatch log metric filter and alarm to monitor credential report generation.

15. IAM:015: Use temporary security credentials for federated access
    - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_iam_saml_provider` and associated IAM role for SAML-based federation.

Additional security measures and best practices:
- All configurable parameters are exposed as variables to make the module reusable and flexible.
- The module uses secure defaults where possible, such as enforcing strong password policies and enabling access analyzers.
- Consider implementing additional monitoring and alerting for IAM-related activities using CloudTrail and CloudWatch.
- Regularly review and update IAM policies, roles, and group memberships to ensure they adhere to the principle of least privilege.
- Implement a process for regular rotation of IAM access keys and review of inactive users.
- Use AWS Organizations and SCPs for centralized management of multiple AWS accounts.
- Implement a strategy for managing and securing IAM user credentials, including enforcing MFA and regular password changes.
- Consider using AWS Single Sign-On (SSO) for centralized access management across multiple AWS accounts.
- Regularly generate and review IAM credential reports and access advisor data to identify unused permissions and inactive users.
- Implement a process for regular IAM security assessments and penetration testing to identify potential vulnerabilities.
