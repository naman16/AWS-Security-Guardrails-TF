# AWS DMS Security Requirements Implementation Notes

1. dms:001: Enable Multi-AZ for DMS Replication Instances
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `multi_az = true` in the `aws_dms_replication_instance` resource.

2. dms:002: Disable Public Accessibility for DMS Replication Instances
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `publicly_accessible = false` in the `aws_dms_replication_instance` resource.

3. dms:003: Enable Auto Minor Version Upgrade for DMS Replication Instances
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `auto_minor_version_upgrade = true` in the `aws_dms_replication_instance` resource.

4. dms:004: Enable SSL Mode for DMS Endpoints
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `ssl_mode = "verify-full"` in the `aws_dms_endpoint` resource.

5. dms:005: Use KMS Customer Managed Key for DMS Endpoint Encryption
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `kms_key_arn` in the `aws_dms_endpoint` resource.

6. dms:006: Use KMS Customer Managed Key for DMS Replication Instance Encryption
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `kms_key_arn` in the `aws_dms_replication_instance` resource.

7. dms:007: Use KMS Customer Managed Key for DMS S3 Endpoint Encryption
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `kms_key_arn` in the `aws_dms_s3_endpoint` resource.

8. dms:008: Implement Network Isolation for DMS Replication Instances
   - Partially implemented in Terraform code by setting `vpc_security_group_ids` and `replication_subnet_group_id` in the `aws_dms_replication_instance` resource. The actual security group and subnet group configurations are not included in this module.

9. dms:009: Enable CloudWatch Monitoring for DMS Replication Instances
   - Not explicitly implemented in Terraform code as CloudWatch monitoring is enabled by default for DMS replication instances.

10. dms:010: Implement IAM Roles for DMS Task Execution
    - Partially implemented in Terraform code by setting `replication_task_settings` in the `aws_dms_replication_task` resource. The actual IAM role creation is not included in this module.

11. dms:011: Enable Change Data Capture (CDC) Validation for DMS Tasks
    - Implemented in Terraform code by setting `cdc_start_time` in the `aws_dms_replication_task` resource.

12. dms:012: Implement Data Validation for DMS Tasks
    - Partially implemented in Terraform code by setting `table_mappings` in the `aws_dms_replication_task` resource. Additional validation rules may need to be added based on specific requirements.

13. dms:013: Use VPC Endpoints for DMS Access to AWS Services
    - Not directly implemented in Terraform. VPC endpoints should be created separately and associated with the VPC where DMS resources are deployed.

14. dms:014: Implement Resource Tagging for DMS Resources
    - Implemented in Terraform code by adding `tags` to all DMS resources.

15. dms:015: Enable AWS Secrets Manager Integration for DMS Endpoint Credentials
    - Implemented in Terraform code by setting `secrets_manager_access_role_arn` and `secrets_manager_arn` in the `aws_dms_endpoint` resource.

Additional security measures and best practices:
- All configurable parameters are exposed as variables to make the module reusable and flexible.
- The module uses secure options by default, such as disabling public accessibility and enabling encryption.
- The module assumes that KMS keys, security groups, subnet groups, and Secrets Manager secrets already exist and requires their IDs/ARNs as input.
- Consider implementing additional monitoring and alerting for DMS tasks and replication instances.
- Regularly review and audit DMS configurations and access logs to ensure compliance with security requirements.
- Implement least privilege access principles when defining IAM roles for DMS tasks and endpoints.
