# AWS Security Group Security Requirements Implementation Notes

1. securitygroup:001: Restrict all traffic in default security group for every VPC
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_default_security_group` resource with empty ingress and egress rules.

2. securitygroup:002: Prevent unrestricted inbound access on all ports
   - Implemented in Terraform code by not allowing any default ingress rules in the `aws_security_group` resource.

3. securitygroup:003: Prevent unrestricted inbound SSH access
   - Implemented in Terraform code by not allowing any default SSH (port 22) ingress rules in the `aws_security_group` resource.

4. securitygroup:004: Prevent unrestricted inbound RDP access
   - Implemented in Terraform code by not allowing any default RDP (port 3389) ingress rules in the `aws_security_group` resource.

5. securitygroup:005: Prevent unrestricted inbound HTTP access
   - Implemented in Terraform code by not allowing any default HTTP (port 80) ingress rules in the `aws_security_group` resource.

6. securitygroup:006: Ensure all security groups are attached to AWS resources
   - Not directly implementable in Terraform. This requires manual or automated checks outside of the module.

7. securitygroup:007: Implement least privilege access in security group rules
   - Implemented in Terraform code by allowing users to define specific ingress and egress rules through variables.

8. securitygroup:008: Use security group names and descriptions effectively
   - Implemented in Terraform code by using the `name` and `description` arguments in the `aws_security_group` resource.

9. securitygroup:009: Limit number of rules per security group
   - Partially implemented by allowing users to define rules through variables. Additional checks may be needed outside the module.

10. securitygroup:010: Use VPC endpoints for AWS service access
    - Not directly implementable in this module. VPC endpoints should be managed separately.

11. securitygroup:011: Implement security group egress rules
    - Implemented in Terraform code by allowing users to define specific egress rules through variables.

12. securitygroup:012: Use security groups as sources in rules
    - Implemented in Terraform code by allowing security groups as sources in the ingress and egress rule definitions.

13. securitygroup:013: Implement regular security group audits
    - Not directly implementable in Terraform. This requires setting up separate auditing processes.

14. securitygroup:014: Use Network ACLs in conjunction with security groups
    - Not implemented in this module. Network ACLs should be managed separately.

15. securitygroup:015: Tag security groups for better management
    - Implemented in Terraform code by allowing users to provide tags through variables.

Additional security measures and best practices:
- The module uses the most secure options by default, such as not allowing any inbound traffic in the default security group.
- All configurable parameters are exposed as variables to make the module reusable and flexible.
- The module allows for granular control over ingress and egress rules, promoting the principle of least privilege.
- Consider implementing additional access controls and monitoring for the security groups.
- Regularly review and audit security group rules to ensure compliance with security requirements.
- Implement a process to remove unused or unnecessary security groups and rules.
- Use descriptive names and tags for easy identification and management of security groups.
- Consider using AWS Config rules or custom scripts to continuously monitor and enforce security group best practices.
