# AWS Data Lifecycle Manager (DLM) Security Requirements Implementation Notes

1. dlm:001: Define EBS Snapshot Lifecycle Policies
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_dlm_lifecycle_policy` resource.

2. dlm:002: Encrypt DLM Cross-Region Copy Events with AWS KMS Customer Managed Key
   - Implemented in Terraform code within the `aws_dlm_lifecycle_policy` resource using the `cross_region_copy_rule` block.

3. dlm:003: Encrypt DLM Cross-Region Copy Schedules with AWS KMS Customer Managed Key
   - Implemented in Terraform code within the `aws_dlm_lifecycle_policy` resource using the `cross_region_copy_rule` block.

4. dlm:004: Implement Least Privilege Access for DLM Policies
   - Not directly implemented in Terraform. This requires custom IAM policy implementation based on specific use cases.

5. dlm:005: Enable Retention of DLM Policy-Created Resources
   - Implemented in Terraform code within the `aws_dlm_lifecycle_policy` resource using the `retain_rule` block.

6. dlm:006: Use Tags for DLM Policy Resource Selection
   - Implemented in Terraform code within the `aws_dlm_lifecycle_policy` resource using the `target_tags` attribute.

7. dlm:007: Implement Cross-Account Sharing for DLM Snapshots
   - Implemented in Terraform code using a separate `aws_dlm_lifecycle_policy` resource with cross-account sharing configuration.

8. dlm:008: Enable Fast Snapshot Restore for Critical Volumes
   - Implemented in Terraform code using a separate `aws_dlm_lifecycle_policy` resource with Fast Snapshot Restore configuration.

9. dlm:009: Implement Monitoring for DLM Policy Execution
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_cloudwatch_metric_alarm` resource to monitor DLM policy execution failures.

10. dlm:010: Regularly Review and Update DLM Policies
    - Not directly implementable in Terraform. This is an operational practice that should be part of your regular maintenance procedures.

Additional security measures and best practices:
- All configurable parameters are exposed as variables to make the module reusable and flexible.
- The module uses secure options by default, such as enabling encryption for cross-region copies.
- The module assumes that KMS keys and IAM roles already exist and requires their ARNs as input.
- Consider implementing additional monitoring and alerting for DLM policy executions and snapshot creations.
- Implement least privilege access principles when defining IAM policies for DLM execution roles.
- Regularly review and audit DLM policies to ensure they align with current business needs and compliance requirements.
- Ensure that the retention periods and snapshot schedules are appropriate for your data protection and cost optimization needs.
- When using cross-account sharing, carefully manage the list of target accounts to prevent unintended data exposure.
- Regularly test the restoration process from DLM-created snapshots to ensure they meet your recovery time objectives (RTOs).
