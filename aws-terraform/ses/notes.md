# AWS SES Security Requirements Implementation Notes

1. ses:001: Restrict SES identity access to known principals or accounts
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_ses_identity_policy` resource.

2. ses:002: Enforce TLS for SES Configuration Sets
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_ses_configuration_set` resource with TLS policy set to "Require".

3. ses:003: Enable DKIM signing for SES identities
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_ses_domain_dkim` resource.

4. ses:004: Implement SPF records for SES domains
   - Not directly implementable in Terraform. This requires manual DNS configuration or use of a DNS provider's Terraform module.

5. ses:005: Enable SES event publishing to CloudWatch
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_ses_event_destination` resource with CloudWatch as the destination.

6. ses:006: Implement SES suppression list management
   - Not directly implementable in Terraform. This requires operational processes or custom scripts to manage the suppression list.

7. ses:007: Use SES API v2 for enhanced security features
   - This is a best practice recommendation and doesn't require a specific Terraform resource. It should be implemented at the application level.

8. ses:008: Implement SES sending authorization policies
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_ses_identity_policy` resource with a policy allowing specific principals to send emails.

9. ses:009: Enable SES feedback notifications
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_ses_identity_notification_topic` resource for bounce, complaint, and delivery notifications.

10. ses:010: Implement SES content filtering
    - Partially implemented in Terraform code using `aws_ses_receipt_rule_set` and `aws_ses_receipt_rule` resources with scan_enabled set to true.

Additional security measures and best practices:
- All configurable parameters are exposed as variables to make the module reusable and flexible.
- The module uses secure options by default, such as enforcing TLS and enabling DKIM signing.
- Consider implementing additional access controls and monitoring for SES and its associated resources.
- Implement least privilege access principles when defining IAM policies for SES usage.
- Regularly review and audit SES configurations, policies, and logs to ensure compliance with security requirements.
- Ensure that SPF records are manually configured for all domains used with SES.
- Implement a process for managing the SES suppression list outside of Terraform.
- Use SES API v2 in your applications when interacting with SES for enhanced security features.
