# AWS CloudTrail Security Requirements Implementation Notes

1. CloudTrail:001: Enable CloudTrail Insights for enhanced monitoring
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `insight_selector` block in `aws_cloudtrail` resource.

2. CloudTrail:002: Enable log file validation for CloudTrail
   - Implemented in Terraform code by setting `enable_log_file_validation = true` in `aws_cloudtrail` resource.

3. CloudTrail:003: Integrate CloudTrail with CloudWatch Logs
   - Implemented in Terraform code by setting `cloud_watch_logs_group_arn` and `cloud_watch_logs_role_arn` in `aws_cloudtrail` resource.

4. CloudTrail:004: Encrypt CloudTrail log files at rest using KMS CMK
   - Implemented in Terraform code by setting `kms_key_id` in `aws_cloudtrail` resource.

5. CloudTrail:005: Enable CloudTrail log file S3 bucket access logging
   - Not directly implemented in this module. This should be configured on the S3 bucket itself, which is assumed to be created separately.

6. CloudTrail:006: Configure CloudTrail to log data events for S3 buckets
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `event_selector` block in `aws_cloudtrail` resource.

7. CloudTrail:007: Enable CloudTrail multi-region logging
   - Implemented in Terraform code by setting `is_multi_region_trail = true` in `aws_cloudtrail` resource.

8. CloudTrail:008: Configure CloudTrail to use an SNS topic for notifications
   - Implemented in Terraform code by setting `sns_topic_name` in `aws_cloudtrail` resource.

9. CloudTrail:009: Use KMS CMK for CloudTrail Event Data Store encryption
   - Implemented in Terraform code by setting `kms_key_id` in `aws_cloudtrail_event_data_store` resource.

10. CloudTrail:010: Implement least privilege access for CloudTrail resources
    - Partially implemented by creating two IAM policies: one for read-only access and one for write access to CloudTrail. These policies should be attached to appropriate IAM roles or users based on their specific needs.

Additional security measures and best practices:
- The module uses secure defaults, such as enabling multi-region logging and log file validation.
- CloudTrail Event Data Store is configured with multi-region and organization-wide logging enabled, and termination protection is turned on.
- The module assumes that S3 buckets, KMS keys, CloudWatch log groups, and SNS topics already exist and requires their names/ARNs as input.
- Consider implementing additional monitoring and alerting for CloudTrail activities.
- Regularly review and audit CloudTrail logs and access patterns.
- Ensure that the S3 bucket used for CloudTrail logs has appropriate access controls and encryption settings.
- Consider implementing AWS Organizations and enabling CloudTrail for the entire organization for comprehensive logging across all accounts.
