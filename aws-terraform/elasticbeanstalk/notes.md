# AWS Elastic Beanstalk Security Requirements Implementation Notes

1. elasticbeanstalk:001: Enable Managed Platform Updates for Elastic Beanstalk Environments
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws:elasticbeanstalk:managedactions` settings.

2. elasticbeanstalk:002: Enable Enhanced Health Reporting for Elastic Beanstalk Environments
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws:elasticbeanstalk:healthreporting:system` setting.

3. elasticbeanstalk:003: Stream Elastic Beanstalk Environment Logs to CloudWatch Logs
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws:elasticbeanstalk:cloudwatch:logs` setting.

4. elasticbeanstalk:004: Use VPC for Elastic Beanstalk Environments
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws:ec2:vpc` settings.

5. elasticbeanstalk:005: Enable HTTPS for Elastic Beanstalk Environment URLs
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws:elb:listener:443` settings.

6. elasticbeanstalk:006: Use IAM Instance Profiles for Elastic Beanstalk EC2 Instances
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws:autoscaling:launchconfiguration` setting for IamInstanceProfile.

7. elasticbeanstalk:007: Enable Encryption for Elastic Beanstalk Environment Resources
   - Partially implemented in Terraform code by enabling root volume encryption. Additional encryption for other resources (e.g., RDS) would require further configuration.

8. elasticbeanstalk:008: Implement Strict Security Group Rules for Elastic Beanstalk Environments
   - Partially implemented by specifying a security group. Actual security group rules need to be defined separately.

9. elasticbeanstalk:009: Enable X-Ray Tracing for Elastic Beanstalk Applications
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws:elasticbeanstalk:xray` setting.

10. elasticbeanstalk:010: Use Environment Variables for Sensitive Configuration in Elastic Beanstalk
    - Implemented in Terraform code using dynamic `aws:elasticbeanstalk:application:environment` settings.

11. elasticbeanstalk:011: Implement Auto Scaling for Elastic Beanstalk Environments
    - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws:autoscaling:asg` settings.

12. elasticbeanstalk:012: Enable Elastic Beanstalk Managed Updates for RDS Databases
    - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws:rds:dbinstance` settings.

13. elasticbeanstalk:013: Implement Resource-Based Policies for Elastic Beanstalk S3 Buckets
    - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_s3_bucket_policy` resource.

14. elasticbeanstalk:014: Use Latest Elastic Beanstalk Platform Version
    - Partially implemented by using LoadBalanced environment type. The actual platform version should be specified in the `solution_stack_name` variable.

15. elasticbeanstalk:015: Implement AWS WAF for Elastic Beanstalk Environments
    - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_wafv2_web_acl_association` resource.

Additional security measures and best practices:
- All configurable parameters are exposed as variables to make the module reusable and flexible.
- The module uses secure defaults where possible, such as enabling encryption and restricting public access to S3 buckets.
- The module assumes that VPC, security groups, SSL certificates, and WAF WebACLs already exist and requires their IDs/ARNs as input.
- Consider implementing additional monitoring and alerting for the Elastic Beanstalk environment.
- Implement least privilege access principles when defining IAM policies for the instance profile.
- Regularly update the Elastic Beanstalk platform version to ensure the latest security patches are applied.
- Ensure that the RDS instance (if used) is properly configured with encryption and backups.
- Implement proper key management for any KMS keys used for encryption.
