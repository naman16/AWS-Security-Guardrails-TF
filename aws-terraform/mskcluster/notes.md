# AWS MSK Cluster Security Requirements Implementation Notes

1. mskcluster:001: Use AWS KMS Customer Managed Key (CMK) for MSK Cluster Encryption at Rest
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `encryption_info` block with `encryption_at_rest_kms_key_arn`.

2. mskcluster:002: Enable TLS Encryption for MSK Cluster Data in Transit
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `encryption_info` block with `encryption_in_transit` set to TLS.

3. mskcluster:003: Enable Logging for MSK Cluster
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `logging_info` block for both CloudWatch and S3 logs.

4. mskcluster:004: Deploy MSK Cluster in Private Subnets
   - Implemented in Terraform code by using `client_subnets` variable, which should be set to private subnet IDs.

5. mskcluster:005: Implement Fine-Grained Access Control for MSK Cluster
   - Partially implemented through `client_authentication` block. Additional IAM policies may be required based on specific use cases.

6. mskcluster:006: Configure Security Groups for MSK Cluster
   - Implemented in Terraform code by using `security_groups` in the `broker_node_group_info` block.

7. mskcluster:007: Enable Enhanced Monitoring for MSK Cluster
   - Implemented in Terraform code by setting `enhanced_monitoring = "PER_BROKER"`.

8. mskcluster:008: Implement MSK Cluster Multi-AZ Deployment
   - Implemented by default when using multiple subnets across AZs in `client_subnets`.

9. mskcluster:009: Enable Automatic Version Upgrades for MSK Cluster
   - Not directly implementable in Terraform. This is managed through AWS console or CLI.

10. mskcluster:010: Implement MSK Cluster Scaling and Rightsizing
    - Partially implemented by setting `number_of_broker_nodes` and `instance_type`. Auto-scaling is not directly supported in MSK and requires manual intervention.

11. mskcluster:011: Enable MSK Cluster Monitoring with Prometheus
    - Implemented in Terraform code using `open_monitoring` block with Prometheus exporters enabled.

12. mskcluster:012: Implement Secure Client Authentication for MSK Cluster
    - Implemented in Terraform code using `client_authentication` block with TLS and SASL/SCRAM options.

13. mskcluster:013: Enable MSK Cluster Configuration History
    - Implemented implicitly by using `aws_msk_configuration` resource. AWS maintains configuration history automatically.

14. mskcluster:014: Implement MSK Cluster Backup and Recovery Strategy
    - Not directly implementable in Terraform. Requires additional operational procedures and possibly Lambda functions for automated backups.

15. mskcluster:015: Use Custom Configuration for MSK Cluster
    - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_msk_configuration` resource with custom Kafka settings.

Additional security measures and best practices:
- All configurable parameters are exposed as variables to make the module reusable and flexible.
- The module uses secure default values where possible (e.g., TLS encryption, enhanced monitoring).
- The module assumes that KMS keys, VPC subnets, security groups, and log destinations already exist and requires their IDs/ARNs as input.
- Consider implementing additional monitoring and alerting for the MSK cluster using CloudWatch alarms.
- Regularly review and update the Kafka version to ensure the latest security patches are applied.
- Implement least privilege access principles when defining IAM policies for cluster access.
- Regularly audit client authentication methods and access patterns to ensure compliance with security requirements.
- Consider implementing network ACLs in addition to security groups for an extra layer of network security.
