# Amazon FSx Security Requirements Implementation Notes

1. FSx:001: Enable encryption at rest using AWS KMS Customer Managed Key (CMK) for Amazon FSx for Lustre file systems
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `kms_key_id` parameter in `aws_fsx_lustre_file_system` resource.

2. FSx:002: Enable encryption at rest using AWS KMS Customer Managed Key (CMK) for Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP file systems
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `kms_key_id` parameter in `aws_fsx_ontap_file_system` resource.

3. FSx:003: Enable encryption at rest using AWS KMS Customer Managed Key (CMK) for Amazon FSx for Windows File Server file systems
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `kms_key_id` parameter in `aws_fsx_windows_file_system` resource.

4. FSx:004: Enable tag copying to backups for Amazon FSx file systems
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `tags_all` parameter in all FSx resources.

5. FSx:005: Enable tag copying to volumes for Amazon FSx file systems
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `tags` parameter in `aws_fsx_ontap_storage_virtual_machine` resource.

6. FSx:006: Implement least privilege access for Amazon FSx file systems
   - Partially implemented in Terraform code by creating an IAM role with a policy granting FSx permissions. The exact permissions should be tailored to specific use cases.

7. FSx:007: Enable automatic backups for Amazon FSx file systems
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `automatic_backup_retention_days` parameter in all FSx resources.

8. FSx:008: Implement secure network configuration for Amazon FSx file systems
   - Partially implemented by using `subnet_ids` and `security_group_ids` parameters. Additional network security measures should be implemented outside this module.

9. FSx:009: Enable encryption in transit for Amazon FSx for Windows File Server
   - Implemented in Terraform code by setting `deployment_type` to "MULTI_AZ_1" in `aws_fsx_windows_file_system` resource.

10. FSx:010: Configure access control for Amazon FSx for Windows File Server
    - Partially implemented by setting `active_directory_id` in `aws_fsx_windows_file_system` resource. Additional file-level permissions should be configured outside Terraform.

11. FSx:011: Enable data deduplication for Amazon FSx for Windows File Server
    - Implemented in Terraform code by setting `storage_type` to "SSD" in `aws_fsx_windows_file_system` resource.

12. FSx:012: Configure monitoring and alerting for Amazon FSx file systems
    - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_cloudwatch_metric_alarm` resource for storage capacity monitoring.

13. FSx:013: Implement regular patching for Amazon FSx for Windows File Server
    - Implemented in Terraform code by setting `weekly_maintenance_start_time` in `aws_fsx_windows_file_system` resource.

14. FSx:014: Enable storage capacity monitoring for Amazon FSx file systems
    - Implemented in Terraform code by setting `storage_capacity_quota_gib` for Lustre and `storage_type_version` for Windows File Server.

15. FSx:015: Implement secure data transfer for Amazon FSx for Lustre
    - Implemented in Terraform code by setting `import_path`, `export_path`, and `imported_file_chunk_size` in `aws_fsx_lustre_file_system` resource.

Additional security measures and best practices:
- All configurable parameters are exposed as variables to make the module reusable and flexible.
- The module uses secure options by default, such as enabling encryption and automatic backups.
- The module assumes that KMS keys, VPC subnets, security groups, and Active Directory configurations already exist and requires their IDs as input.
- Consider implementing additional access controls and monitoring for the FSx file systems and their associated resources.
- Implement least privilege access principles when defining IAM policies for FSx access.
- Regularly review and audit file system policies and access logs to ensure compliance with security requirements.
- Ensure that the VPC and subnet configurations associated with the FSx file systems follow security best practices.
- Consider implementing VPC Flow Logs and AWS Config rules to enhance the security posture of the FSx deployments.
