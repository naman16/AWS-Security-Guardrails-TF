# AWS Backup Security Requirements Implementation Notes

1. backup:001: Enable encryption at rest for AWS Backup recovery points using KMS CMK
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_backup_vault` resource with `kms_key_arn` parameter.

2. backup:002: Create at least one AWS Backup report plan
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_backup_report_plan` resource.

3. backup:003: Create and configure AWS Backup vaults
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_backup_vault` resource.

4. backup:004: Encrypt AWS Backup vaults using KMS CMK
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_backup_vault` resource with `kms_key_arn` parameter.

5. backup:005: Create and implement at least one AWS Backup plan
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_backup_plan` resource.

6. backup:006: Include EBS volumes in AWS Backup plans
   - Implemented in Terraform code within the `aws_backup_plan` resource using the `selection` block.

7. backup:007: Include Amazon EFS file systems in AWS Backup plans
   - Implemented in Terraform code within the `aws_backup_plan` resource using the `selection` block.

8. backup:008: Implement cross-region backup for critical resources
   - Implemented in Terraform code within the `aws_backup_plan` resource using the `copy_action` block.

9. backup:009: Enable continuous backups for supported services
   - Partially implemented in Terraform code. The `aws_backup_plan` resource is configured, but continuous backups need to be enabled per supported resource type.

10. backup:010: Implement least privilege access for AWS Backup
    - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_iam_role` and `aws_iam_role_policy_attachment` resources with AWS managed policies for backup and restore.

11. backup:011: Configure backup lifecycle management
    - Implemented in Terraform code within the `aws_backup_plan` resource using the `lifecycle` block.

12. backup:012: Enable AWS Backup audit manager
    - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_backup_vault_policy` resource to allow necessary permissions for AWS Backup Audit Manager.

13. backup:013: Implement backup notifications using Amazon SNS
    - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_backup_vault_notifications` resource.

14. backup:014: Use resource tagging for AWS Backup management
    - Implemented in Terraform code within the `aws_backup_plan` resource using the `recovery_point_tags` parameter.

15. backup:015: Regularly test backup restoration processes
    - Cannot be directly implemented in Terraform. This is an operational practice that should be scheduled and performed regularly.

Additional security measures and best practices:
- All configurable parameters are exposed as variables to make the module reusable and flexible.
- The module uses secure default values where applicable.
- The module assumes that KMS keys, S3 buckets, and SNS topics already exist and requires their ARNs as input.
- Consider implementing additional monitoring and alerting for backup job statuses and vault access attempts.
- Regularly review and update the backup plans, retention periods, and access policies to ensure they meet evolving business requirements and compliance standards.
- Implement a process for regularly testing the restoration of backups to verify data integrity and recovery procedures.
- Consider implementing cross-account backups for additional isolation and protection of backup data.
