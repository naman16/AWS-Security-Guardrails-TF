# AWS Elasticsearch Security Requirements Implementation Notes

1. elasticsearch:001: Enable encryption at rest using AWS KMS Customer Managed Key (CMK) for Elasticsearch domains
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `encrypt_at_rest` block in `aws_elasticsearch_domain` resource.

2. elasticsearch:002: Enable node-to-node encryption for Elasticsearch domains
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `node_to_node_encryption` block in `aws_elasticsearch_domain` resource.

3. elasticsearch:003: Enable fine-grained access control for Elasticsearch domains
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `advanced_security_options` block in `aws_elasticsearch_domain` resource.

4. elasticsearch:004: Enable audit logging for Elasticsearch domains
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `log_publishing_options` block with `AUDIT_LOGS` log type in `aws_elasticsearch_domain` resource.

5. elasticsearch:005: Enforce HTTPS for all Elasticsearch domain endpoints
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `domain_endpoint_options` block with `enforce_https = true` in `aws_elasticsearch_domain` resource.

6. elasticsearch:006: Configure Elasticsearch domains with at least three dedicated master nodes
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `cluster_config` block with `dedicated_master_enabled = true` and `dedicated_master_count = 3` in `aws_elasticsearch_domain` resource.

7. elasticsearch:007: Deploy Elasticsearch domains within a VPC
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `vpc_options` block in `aws_elasticsearch_domain` resource.

8. elasticsearch:008: Use custom security groups for Elasticsearch domains
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `security_group_ids` in the `vpc_options` block of `aws_elasticsearch_domain` resource.

9. elasticsearch:009: Use latest TLS policy for Elasticsearch domains
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `domain_endpoint_options` block with `tls_security_policy = "Policy-Min-TLS-1-2-2019-07"` in `aws_elasticsearch_domain` resource.

10. elasticsearch:010: Enable error logging for Elasticsearch domains
    - Implemented in Terraform code using `log_publishing_options` block with `ES_APPLICATION_LOGS` log type in `aws_elasticsearch_domain` resource.

11. elasticsearch:011: Implement IP-based access control for Elasticsearch domains
    - Implemented in Terraform code using `access_policies` with IP-based condition in `aws_elasticsearch_domain` resource.

12. elasticsearch:012: Enable automated snapshots for Elasticsearch domains
    - Implemented in Terraform code using `snapshot_options` block in `aws_elasticsearch_domain` resource.

13. elasticsearch:013: Implement least privilege access for Elasticsearch domains
    - Not directly implemented in Terraform. This requires custom IAM policy implementation based on specific use cases.

14. elasticsearch:014: Enable UltraWarm storage for Elasticsearch domains
    - Implemented in Terraform code using `ultra_warm` block in `aws_elasticsearch_domain` resource.

15. elasticsearch:015: Configure cross-cluster search for Elasticsearch domains
    - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_elasticsearch_outbound_cross_cluster_search_connection` resource.

Additional security measures and best practices:
- All configurable parameters are exposed as variables to make the module reusable and flexible.
- The module uses secure options by default, such as enabling encryption, HTTPS enforcement, and fine-grained access control.
- The module assumes that KMS keys, VPC, subnets, security groups, and CloudWatch log groups already exist and requires their IDs/ARNs as input.
- Consider implementing additional monitoring and alerting for the Elasticsearch domain using CloudWatch alarms.
- Regularly review and audit access policies and logs to ensure compliance with security requirements.
- Implement regular backups and disaster recovery procedures for Elasticsearch data.
- Consider using AWS PrivateLink for secure, private connectivity to Elasticsearch domains.
- Regularly update the Elasticsearch version to ensure you have the latest security patches and features.
