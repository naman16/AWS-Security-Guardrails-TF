# Amazon Bedrock Security Requirements Implementation Notes

1. bedrock:001: Enable encryption for Amazon Bedrock model invocation logs using AWS KMS
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_bedrock_model_invocation_logging_configuration` resource with KMS key.

2. bedrock:002: Configure Prompt Attack Filter strength to HIGH for Amazon Bedrock Guardrails
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_bedrock_custom_model_guardrails` resource with HIGH filter strength.

3. bedrock:003: Enable model invocation logging for Amazon Bedrock
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_bedrock_model_invocation_logging_configuration` resource with logging enabled.

4. bedrock:004: Enable Sensitive Information Filters for Amazon Bedrock Guardrails
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_bedrock_custom_model_guardrails` resource with sensitive information filter enabled.

5. bedrock:005: Encrypt Amazon Bedrock Agent with AWS KMS Customer Managed Key
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_bedrock_agent` resource with KMS key specified.

6. bedrock:006: Implement least privilege access for Amazon Bedrock resources
   - Partially implemented in Terraform code by creating separate read and write IAM policies for Bedrock access.

7. bedrock:007: Restrict Amazon Bedrock access to specific VPC endpoints
   - Not directly implementable in Terraform for Bedrock. VPC endpoints are managed outside of this module.

8. bedrock:008: Enable AWS KMS encryption for Amazon Bedrock data at rest
   - Implicitly implemented by using KMS keys for agents and logging.

9. bedrock:009: Implement secure TLS configuration for Amazon Bedrock API calls
   - Not directly implementable in Terraform. AWS automatically handles secure TLS for Bedrock API calls.

10. bedrock:010: Configure Amazon Bedrock to use AWS PrivateLink
    - Not directly implementable in Terraform for Bedrock. PrivateLink configuration is managed outside of this module.

11. bedrock:011: Implement resource-based policies for Amazon Bedrock resources
    - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_bedrock_resource_policy` resource for the Bedrock agent.

12. bedrock:012: Enable AWS Config rules for monitoring Amazon Bedrock configurations
    - Not directly implementable in Terraform. AWS Config rules are typically set up separately from the Bedrock resource configuration.

13. bedrock:013: Implement data retention policies for Amazon Bedrock logs and data
    - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_cloudwatch_log_group` resource with retention period for Bedrock logs.

14. bedrock:014: Configure Amazon Bedrock to use AWS WAF for API protection
    - Not directly implementable in Terraform for Bedrock. WAF configuration is typically done at the API Gateway or Application Load Balancer level.

15. bedrock:015: Implement regular security assessments for Amazon Bedrock deployments
    - Not directly implementable in Terraform. This is an operational practice rather than a configuration setting.

Additional security measures and best practices:
- All configurable parameters are exposed as variables to make the module reusable and flexible.
- The module uses secure options by default, such as enabling encryption and configuring guardrails.
- The module assumes that KMS keys and IAM roles already exist and requires their ARNs as input.
- Consider implementing additional monitoring and alerting for Bedrock usage and potential security incidents.
- Regularly review and audit Bedrock configurations and access patterns to ensure compliance with security requirements.
- Implement network security controls (e.g., VPC endpoints, PrivateLink) outside of this module to enhance the security posture of Bedrock deployments.
