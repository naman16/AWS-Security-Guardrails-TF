# AWS Athena Security Requirements Implementation Notes

1. athena:001: Enable encryption at rest for Amazon Athena query results using AWS KMS Customer Managed Key (CMK)
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_athena_workgroup` resource with encryption configuration.

2. athena:002: Enforce workgroup configuration to prevent client-side overrides
   - Implemented in Terraform code by setting `enforce_workgroup_configuration = true` in the `aws_athena_workgroup` resource.

3. athena:003: Enable logging for Amazon Athena workgroups
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_cloudwatch_log_group` resource for Athena logs.

4. athena:004: Use AWS KMS Customer Managed Key (CMK) for encrypting Athena databases
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_glue_catalog_database` resource with encryption configuration.

5. athena:005: Implement fine-grained access control for Athena resources
   - Partially implemented in Terraform code by creating IAM policies for read and write access to Athena resources.
   - Full implementation requires assigning these policies to specific IAM users/roles based on organizational needs.

6. athena:006: Configure Athena workgroups with query result location encryption
   - Implemented in Terraform code within the `aws_athena_workgroup` resource, using the same configuration as athena:001.

7. athena:007: Enable Athena query result reuse
   - Implemented in Terraform code within the `aws_athena_workgroup` resource by enabling query caching and setting a TTL.

8. athena:008: Implement Athena prepared statements for security-sensitive queries
   - Not directly implementable in Terraform. This is a best practice for query writing and should be implemented at the application level.

9. athena:009: Configure Athena workgroup query timeout
   - Implemented in Terraform code within the `aws_athena_workgroup` resource by setting `query_timeout_in_seconds`.

10. athena:010: Use Athena federated query for secure access to diverse data sources
    - Partially implemented in Terraform by creating an IAM role for Athena federated queries.
    - Full implementation requires setting up specific data source connectors, which is typically done through the AWS console or CLI.

Additional security measures and best practices:
- All configurable parameters are exposed as variables to make the module reusable and flexible.
- The module uses secure options by default, such as enforcing workgroup configurations and enabling encryption.
- The module assumes that KMS keys and S3 buckets for query results already exist and requires their ARNs as input.
- Consider implementing additional access controls and monitoring for Athena resources.
- Implement least privilege access principles when defining and assigning IAM policies for Athena access.
- Regularly review and audit Athena workgroup configurations, database encryption settings, and access logs to ensure compliance with security requirements.
- For athena:008, while not directly implementable in Terraform, ensure that your application code uses prepared statements when interacting with Athena for security-sensitive queries.
- For athena:010, after applying this Terraform configuration, set up the necessary data source connectors for federated queries through the AWS console or CLI.
