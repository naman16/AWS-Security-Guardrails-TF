Additional security measures and best practices:
- All configurable parameters are exposed as variables to make the module reusable and flexible.
- The module uses secure options by default, such as enforcing strong password policies and restricting regions.
- Consider implementing additional monitoring and alerting for changes to organization policies and structure.
- Regularly review and audit organization policies to ensure compliance with security requirements.
- Implement least privilege access principles when defining organization policies and member account permissions.
- Use AWS CloudFormation StackSets or AWS Control Tower for additional organization-wide resource provisioning and governance.
