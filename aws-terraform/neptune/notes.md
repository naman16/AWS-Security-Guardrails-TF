# AWS Neptune Security Requirements Implementation Notes

1. neptune:001 - Enable CloudWatch audit logs for Neptune Clusters
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `enabled_cloudwatch_logs_exports = ["audit"]` in the `aws_neptune_cluster` resource.

2. neptune:002 - Enable encryption at rest for Neptune Clusters using AWS KMS Customer Managed Keys (CMK)
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `kms_key_arn` and `storage_encrypted = true` in the `aws_neptune_cluster` resource.

3. neptune:003 - Enable tag copying to snapshots for Neptune DB clusters
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `copy_tags_to_snapshot = true` in the `aws_neptune_cluster` resource.

4. neptune:004 - Enable encryption for Neptune DB cluster snapshots using AWS KMS Customer Managed Keys (CMK)
   - Implemented implicitly through neptune:002, as snapshots inherit the encryption settings of the source cluster.

5. neptune:005 - Configure appropriate backup retention period for Neptune Clusters
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `backup_retention_period` in the `aws_neptune_cluster` resource.

6. neptune:006 - Enable IAM authentication for Neptune Clusters
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `iam_database_authentication_enabled = true` in the `aws_neptune_cluster` resource.

7. neptune:007 - Ensure Neptune Clusters are deployed in private subnets
   - Implemented by using `db_subnet_group_name` in the `aws_neptune_cluster` resource. The subnet group should be created separately with private subnets.

8. neptune:008 - Prevent public accessibility of Neptune DB manual cluster snapshots
   - Not directly implementable in Terraform. This is a configuration setting when creating manual snapshots, which is typically done outside of Terraform.

9. neptune:009 - Enable Multi-AZ deployment for Neptune Clusters
   - Implemented by providing multiple `availability_zones` in the `aws_neptune_cluster` resource.

10. neptune:010 - Enable deletion protection for Neptune Clusters
    - Implemented in Terraform code using `deletion_protection = true` in the `aws_neptune_cluster` resource.

11. neptune:011 - Configure secure TLS connections for Neptune Clusters
    - Implemented using `aws_neptune_cluster_parameter_group` resource with `neptune_enforce_ssl` parameter set to "1".

12. neptune:012 - Implement least privilege access for Neptune Clusters
    - Partially implemented by creating separate IAM roles and policies for read and write access. Users should use these roles based on their needs.

13. neptune:013 - Enable VPC security group restrictions for Neptune Clusters
    - Implemented using `aws_security_group_rule` to allow inbound traffic on port 8182 from specified CIDR blocks.

14. neptune:014 - Implement regular patching for Neptune Clusters
    - Not directly implementable in Terraform. This requires operational processes outside of infrastructure-as-code.

15. neptune:015 - Monitor Neptune Cluster performance and security metrics
    - Implemented using `aws_cloudwatch_metric_alarm` resources for CPU utilization and failed login attempts.

Additional security measures and best practices:
- All configurable parameters are exposed as variables to make the module reusable and flexible.
- The module uses secure options by default, such as enabling encryption, IAM authentication, and deletion protection.
- The module assumes that KMS keys, VPC, subnets, and security groups already exist and requires their IDs/ARNs as input.
- Consider implementing additional monitoring and alerting based on specific use cases and requirements.
- Regularly review and audit cluster configurations, access logs, and performance metrics to ensure ongoing security and compliance.
- Implement proper key rotation and management for the KMS keys used for encryption.
- Consider using AWS Secrets Manager or AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store for secure storage and management of database credentials.
