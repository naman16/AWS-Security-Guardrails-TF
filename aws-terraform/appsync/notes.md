# AWS AppSync Security Requirements Implementation Notes

1. appsync:001: Use AWS KMS Customer Managed Key (CMK) for AppSync API Cache Encryption at Rest
   - Implemented in Terraform code using the `cache` block in the `aws_appsync_graphql_api` resource with `at_rest_encryption_enabled = true`.

2. appsync:002: Enable Encryption in Transit for AppSync API Cache
   - Implemented in Terraform code using the `cache` block in the `aws_appsync_graphql_api` resource with `transit_encryption_enabled = true`.

3. appsync:003: Enable Field-Level Logging for AppSync API
   - Implemented in Terraform code using the `log_config` block in the `aws_appsync_graphql_api` resource with `field_log_level = "ALL"`.

4. appsync:004: Enable CloudWatch Logging for AppSync API
   - Implemented in Terraform code using the `log_config` block in the `aws_appsync_graphql_api` resource.

5. appsync:005: Integrate AppSync API with AWS WAF
   - Partially implemented by adding an additional authentication provider. Full WAF integration requires additional resources not included in this module.

6. appsync:006: Implement Least Privilege Access for AppSync API
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_iam_role` and `aws_iam_role_policy` resources with minimal permissions.

7. appsync:007: Enable AWS CloudTrail for AppSync API Monitoring
   - Not implemented in this module. CloudTrail should be configured at the account level.

8. appsync:008: Implement Private Endpoints for AppSync API
   - Not implemented in this module. VPC endpoints should be configured separately.

9. appsync:009: Enable HTTPS-Only Access for AppSync API
   - Inherently implemented as AppSync APIs only support HTTPS access.

10. appsync:010: Implement Strong Authentication for AppSync API
    - Implemented by setting `authentication_type = "AWS_IAM"` in the `aws_appsync_graphql_api` resource.

11. appsync:011: Enable and Configure API Request Throttling
    - Implemented in Terraform code using the `throttle_config` block in the `aws_appsync_graphql_api` resource.

12. appsync:012: Implement Data Validation for AppSync API Inputs
    - Partially implemented by creating a resolver with request and response templates. Full implementation requires custom validation logic in the templates.

13. appsync:013: Enable and Configure AppSync API Caching Securely
    - Implemented in Terraform code using the `cache` block in the `aws_appsync_graphql_api` resource.

14. appsync:014: Implement Secure Error Handling for AppSync API
    - Partially implemented by creating a function with request and response mapping templates. Full implementation requires custom error handling logic in the templates.

15. appsync:015: Use Latest GraphQL Schema Version for AppSync API
    - Implemented by providing the schema file path as a variable, allowing users to update the schema as needed.

Additional security measures and best practices:
- The module uses secure defaults, such as enabling encryption for caching and using AWS IAM for authentication.
- X-Ray tracing is enabled for enhanced monitoring and debugging.
- All configurable parameters are exposed as variables to make the module reusable and flexible.
- Consider implementing additional access controls and monitoring for the AppSync API and its associated resources.
- Regularly review and update the GraphQL schema and resolver logic to maintain security best practices.
- Implement proper error handling and input validation in resolver and function mapping templates.
- Regularly audit API access patterns and adjust IAM policies as needed to maintain least privilege access.
