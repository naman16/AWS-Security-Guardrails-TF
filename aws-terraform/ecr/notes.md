# AWS ECR Security Requirements Implementation Notes

1. ECR:001: Enable Encryption at Rest using AWS KMS Customer Managed Key (CMK) for ECR Repositories
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `encryption_configuration` block in `aws_ecr_repository` resource.

2. ECR:002: Enable Image Scanning on Push for ECR Repositories
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `image_scanning_configuration` block in `aws_ecr_repository` resource.

3. ECR:003: Configure Tag Immutability for ECR Repositories
   - Implemented in Terraform code by setting `image_tag_mutability = "IMMUTABLE"` in `aws_ecr_repository` resource.

4. ECR:004: Implement Lifecycle Policies for ECR Repositories
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_ecr_lifecycle_policy` resource.

5. ECR:005: Ensure ECR Repositories are Private
   - Implemented by default in Terraform code. ECR repositories are private by default.

6. ECR:006: Implement Least Privilege Access for ECR Repositories
   - Partially implemented in Terraform code using `aws_ecr_repository_policy` resource with separate pull and push permissions.

7. ECR:007: Enable Encryption in Transit for ECR Repositories
   - Not directly implemented in Terraform. This is enforced by default by AWS for all ECR interactions.

8. ECR:008: Implement Cross-Region Replication for Critical ECR Repositories
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_ecr_replication_configuration` resource.

9. ECR:009: Monitor and Remediate Vulnerabilities in ECR Images
   - Not directly implemented in Terraform. This requires operational processes and potentially additional tools or scripts.

10. ECR:010: Implement ECR Repository Policies
    - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_ecr_repository_policy` resource.

11. ECR:011: Enable AWS CloudTrail for ECR API Activity Monitoring
    - Not implemented in this module. Assumed to be enabled at the account level for all services.

12. ECR:012: Implement ECR Image Tagging Strategy
    - Partially implemented by creating a separate repository with tags. Full implementation requires operational processes.

13. ECR:013: Use FIPS Endpoints for ECR in Sensitive Workloads
    - Not directly implemented in Terraform. This requires configuration at the client level when interacting with ECR.

14. ECR:014: Implement ECR Pull Through Cache Repositories Securely
    - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_ecr_pull_through_cache_rule` resource.

15. ECR:015: Enable ECR Scan Findings Export to Security Hub
    - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_ecr_registry_scanning_configuration` resource with ENHANCED scan type.

Additional security measures and best practices:
- All configurable parameters are exposed as variables to make the module reusable and flexible.
- The module uses the most secure options by default, such as enabling encryption, image scanning, and tag immutability.
- The module assumes that KMS keys already exist and requires their ARNs as input.
- Consider implementing additional monitoring and alerting for ECR repositories and their associated resources.
- Implement least privilege access principles when defining IAM policies for ECR access.
- Regularly review and audit repository policies and scan results to ensure compliance with security requirements.
- Implement a process for regular updates and patching of base images used in your containers.
- Consider implementing additional controls for image signing and verification to ensure image integrity.
