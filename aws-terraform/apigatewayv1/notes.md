# AWS API Gateway v1 Security Requirements Implementation Notes

1. apigatewayv1:001: Use private API Gateway endpoints
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_api_gateway_rest_api` resource with `endpoint_configuration` set to `PRIVATE`.

2. apigatewayv1:002: Enable AWS X-Ray tracing for API Gateway REST API stages
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_api_gateway_stage` resource with `xray_tracing_enabled = true`.

3. apigatewayv1:003: Attach AWS WAF ACL to API Gateway stages
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_api_gateway_stage` resource with `web_acl_arn` attribute.

4. apigatewayv1:004: Enable logging for API Gateway stages
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_api_gateway_stage` resource with `access_log_settings` block.

5. apigatewayv1:005: Enable client certificate authentication for backend endpoints
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_api_gateway_client_certificate` resource and associated with the stage.

6. apigatewayv1:006: Encrypt API Gateway REST API cache data at rest
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_api_gateway_method_settings` resource with `cache_data_encrypted = true`.

7. apigatewayv1:007: Configure authorizers for API Gateway at API or method level
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_api_gateway_authorizer` resource and associated with methods.

8. apigatewayv1:008: Use latest TLS security policy for API Gateway custom domain names
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_api_gateway_domain_name` resource with `security_policy = "TLS_1_2"`.

9. apigatewayv1:009: Enable request validation for API Gateway methods
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_api_gateway_request_validator` resource and associated with methods.

10. apigatewayv1:010: Implement throttling for API Gateway methods
    - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_api_gateway_usage_plan` resource with throttle settings.

11. apigatewayv1:011: Enable API Gateway caching with encryption
    - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_api_gateway_stage` and `aws_api_gateway_method_settings` resources with caching enabled and encrypted.

12. apigatewayv1:012: Disable detailed execution logging in API Gateway method settings
    - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_api_gateway_method_settings` resource with `data_trace_enabled = false`.

13. apigatewayv1:013: Implement API key validation for API Gateway methods
    - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_api_gateway_api_key` and `aws_api_gateway_usage_plan_key` resources.

14. apigatewayv1:014: Enable mutual TLS authentication for API Gateway custom domain names
    - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_api_gateway_domain_name` resource with `mutual_tls_authentication` block.

15. apigatewayv1:015: Implement resource policies for API Gateway APIs
    - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_api_gateway_rest_api_policy` resource with a sample policy to restrict access based on IP ranges.

Additional security measures and best practices:
- All configurable parameters are exposed as variables to make the module reusable and flexible.
- The module uses secure options by default, such as enabling encryption, logging, and access controls.
- The module assumes that WAF ACLs, KMS keys, and log groups already exist and requires their ARNs as input.
- Consider implementing additional monitoring and alerting for the API Gateway and its associated resources.
- Implement least privilege access principles when defining IAM roles and policies for API Gateway and associated resources.
- Regularly review and audit API Gateway configurations, access logs, and usage to ensure compliance with security requirements.
- Consider implementing API Gateway usage plans and API keys to control and monitor API usage.
- Ensure that backend services (e.g., Lambda functions) have appropriate security measures in place.
- Regularly update and patch the API Gateway and associated resources to address any security vulnerabilities.
