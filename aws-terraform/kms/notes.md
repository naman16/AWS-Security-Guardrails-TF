# AWS KMS Security Requirements Implementation Notes

1. KMS:001: Enable Key Rotation for Customer Managed Keys (CMK)
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `enable_key_rotation = true` in the `aws_kms_key` resource.

2. KMS:002: Prevent Unintentional Deletion of KMS Keys
   - Implemented in Terraform code by setting `deletion_window_in_days` in the `aws_kms_key` resource. Default is set to 30 days.

3. KMS:003: Ensure KMS Keys Are Actively Used
   - Not directly implementable in Terraform. Requires operational monitoring and auditing.

4. KMS:004: Implement Least Privilege Access for KMS Keys
   - Partially implemented by creating separate read and write IAM policies. The actual key policy needs to be provided by the user.

5. KMS:005: Enable Logging for KMS Key Usage
   - Not directly implementable in Terraform. AWS CloudTrail logs KMS events by default when enabled for all AWS services.

6. KMS:006: Use Separate KMS Keys for Different Applications or Data Classifications
   - Not directly implementable in Terraform. This is a design decision that should be reflected in how the module is used.

7. KMS:007: Implement Multi-Region KMS Keys for Critical Data
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `multi_region = true` in the `aws_kms_key` resource.

8. KMS:008: Regular Review and Rotation of KMS Key Policies
   - Not directly implementable in Terraform. Requires operational processes for regular review and updates.

9. KMS:009: Enable Automatic Key Deletion for Imported Key Material
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_kms_external_key` resource with `valid_to` parameter.

10. KMS:010: Implement KMS Key Aliases for Simplified Management
    - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_kms_alias` resource.

Additional security measures and best practices:
- All configurable parameters are exposed as variables to make the module reusable and flexible.
- The module uses secure defaults, such as enabling key rotation and setting a 30-day deletion window.
- The module allows for the creation of both standard and imported key material KMS keys.
- Consider implementing additional access controls and monitoring for the KMS keys.
- Implement least privilege access principles when defining IAM policies for key access.
- Regularly review and audit key policies and access logs to ensure compliance with security requirements.
- For multi-region keys, ensure that proper controls are in place in all regions where the key is replicated.
- When using imported key material, ensure secure processes for key generation and import.
