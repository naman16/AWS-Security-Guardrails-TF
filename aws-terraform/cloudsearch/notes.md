# AWS CloudSearch Security Requirements Implementation Notes

1. cloudsearch:001: Enforce HTTPS for CloudSearch Domain Access
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `endpoint_options` block in `aws_cloudsearch_domain` resource with `enforce_https = true`.

2. cloudsearch:002: Use Latest TLS Version for CloudSearch Domain Connections
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `endpoint_options` block in `aws_cloudsearch_domain` resource with `tls_security_policy = "Policy-Min-TLS-1-2-2019-07"`.

3. cloudsearch:003: Enable Encryption at Rest for CloudSearch Domain
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `encryption_at_rest_options` block in `aws_cloudsearch_domain` resource.

4. cloudsearch:004: Implement VPC for CloudSearch Domain
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `vpc_options` block in `aws_cloudsearch_domain` resource.

5. cloudsearch:005: Restrict CloudSearch Domain Access to Specific VPC Endpoints
   - Partially implemented in Terraform code using `vpc_options` block in `aws_cloudsearch_domain` resource. Additional network configurations may be required outside of this module.

6. cloudsearch:006: Implement IAM Policies for CloudSearch Domain Access
   - Implemented in Terraform code by creating two IAM policies: one for read access and one for write access to the CloudSearch domain.

7. cloudsearch:007: Enable CloudSearch Domain Monitoring with CloudWatch
   - Implemented in Terraform code by enabling CloudWatch logs in `aws_cloudsearch_domain` resource and creating a CloudWatch alarm for search latency.

8. cloudsearch:008: Implement Regular Backups for CloudSearch Domain Data
   - Not directly implemented in Terraform. This requires a separate process to periodically export data to S3, which is beyond the scope of this CloudSearch domain configuration.

9. cloudsearch:009: Use Secure Configuration for CloudSearch Suggesters
   - Partially implemented in Terraform code by defining a secure index field configuration. However, data sanitization is a runtime concern that cannot be fully addressed in infrastructure code.

10. cloudsearch:010: Implement Access Policies for CloudSearch Document and Search Endpoints
    - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_cloudsearch_domain_service_access_policy` resource.

Additional security measures and best practices:
- All configurable parameters are exposed as variables to make the module reusable and flexible.
- The module uses the most secure options by default, such as enforcing HTTPS and using the latest TLS policy.
- The module assumes that KMS keys, VPC resources, and SNS topics already exist and requires their IDs/ARNs as input.
- Consider implementing additional access controls and monitoring for the CloudSearch domain and its associated resources.
- Implement least privilege access principles when defining IAM policies for domain access.
- Regularly review and audit domain access policies and CloudWatch logs to ensure compliance with security requirements.
- Ensure that the data indexed in CloudSearch does not contain sensitive information that should not be searchable.
