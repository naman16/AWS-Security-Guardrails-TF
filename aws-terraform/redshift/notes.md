# AWS Redshift Security Requirements Implementation Notes

1. redshift:001: Use a custom admin username for Amazon Redshift clusters
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `master_username` parameter in `aws_redshift_cluster` resource.

2. redshift:002: Enable audit logging for Amazon Redshift clusters
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_redshift_cluster_parameter_group` resource with `enable_user_activity_logging` parameter set to true.

3. redshift:003: Enable encryption at rest for Amazon Redshift clusters using AWS KMS Customer Managed Keys (CMKs)
   - Implemented in Terraform code by setting `encrypted = true` and `kms_key_id` in `aws_redshift_cluster` resource.

4. redshift:004: Enable enhanced VPC routing for Amazon Redshift clusters
   - Implemented in Terraform code by setting `enhanced_vpc_routing = true` in `aws_redshift_cluster` resource.

5. redshift:005: Disable public accessibility for Amazon Redshift clusters
   - Implemented in Terraform code by setting `publicly_accessible = false` in `aws_redshift_cluster` resource.

6. redshift:006: Enable automatic version upgrades for Amazon Redshift clusters
   - Implemented in Terraform code by setting `auto_upgrade = true` in `aws_redshift_cluster` resource.

7. redshift:007: Enable Multi-AZ deployment for Amazon Redshift clusters
   - Implemented in Terraform code by setting `multi_az = true` in `aws_redshift_cluster` resource.

8. redshift:008: Enforce SSL/TLS encryption for connections to Amazon Redshift clusters
   - Implemented in Terraform code by setting `require_ssl = true` in `aws_redshift_cluster` resource.

9. redshift:009: Enable automated snapshots for Amazon Redshift clusters
   - Implemented in Terraform code by setting `automated_snapshot_retention_period` in `aws_redshift_cluster` resource.

10. redshift:010: Use a custom database name for Amazon Redshift clusters
    - Implemented in Terraform code using `database_name` parameter in `aws_redshift_cluster` resource.

11. redshift:011: Encrypt Amazon Redshift snapshot copies using AWS KMS Customer Managed Keys (CMKs)
    - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_redshift_snapshot_copy_grant` resource.

12. redshift:012: Encrypt Amazon Redshift Serverless namespaces using AWS KMS Customer Managed Keys (CMKs)
    - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_redshiftserverless_namespace` resource with `kms_key_id` parameter.

13. redshift:013: Implement least privilege access for Amazon Redshift clusters
    - Partially implemented in Terraform code by creating an IAM role with read-only access. Further customization may be required based on specific use cases.

14. redshift:014: Configure VPC security groups for Amazon Redshift clusters
    - Implemented in Terraform code by setting `vpc_security_group_ids` in `aws_redshift_cluster` resource. The actual security group configuration is assumed to be managed separately.

15. redshift:015: Enable Redshift query logging
    - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_redshift_event_subscription` resource to log query events to an SNS topic.

Additional security measures and best practices:
- All configurable parameters are exposed as variables to make the module reusable and flexible.
- The module uses secure options by default, such as enabling encryption, disabling public access, and enforcing SSL.
- The module assumes that KMS keys, security groups, and SNS topics already exist and requires their IDs/ARNs as input.
- Consider implementing additional access controls and monitoring for the Redshift cluster and its associated resources.
- Implement least privilege access principles when defining IAM policies for cluster access.
- Regularly review and audit cluster configurations, parameter groups, and access logs to ensure compliance with security requirements.
- Consider implementing additional security measures such as network isolation, regular vulnerability assessments, and data classification.
