7. cloudwatch:007: Create CloudWatch Log Metric Filters for S3 Bucket Policy Changes
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_cloudwatch_log_metric_filter` resource for S3 bucket policy changes.

8. cloudwatch:008: Implement CloudWatch Log Metric Filters for VPC Changes

11. cloudwatch:011: Establish CloudWatch Log Metric Filters for Root Account Usage
    - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_cloudwatch_log_metric_filter` resource for root account usage.

12. cloudwatch:012: Implement CloudWatch Log Metric Filters for Unauthorized API Calls
    - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_cloudwatch_log_metric_filter` resource for unauthorized API calls.

13. cloudwatch:013: Configure CloudWatch Log Metric Filters for Management Console Authentication Failures
    - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_cloudwatch_log_metric_filter` resource for console login failures.

14. cloudwatch:014: Set Up CloudWatch Log Metric Filters for CloudTrail Configuration Changes
    - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_cloudwatch_log_metric_filter` resource for CloudTrail changes.

15. cloudwatch:015: Create CloudWatch Log Metric Filters for Network Gateway Changes
    - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_cloudwatch_log_metric_filter` resource for network gateway changes.

Additional security measures and best practices:
- All configurable parameters are exposed as variables to make the module reusable and flexible.
- The module uses secure defaults, such as setting a 365-day retention period for log groups.
- The module assumes that KMS keys and SNS topics for alarm actions already exist and requires their ARNs as input.
- Consider implementing additional monitoring and alerting based on the metric filters created.
- Regularly review and update the metric filters and alarms to ensure they meet evolving security requirements.
- Implement least privilege access principles when defining IAM policies for CloudWatch access.
- Ensure that the appropriate teams are notified when alarms are triggered.
- Regularly audit CloudWatch logs and metrics to identify potential security issues or anomalies.
