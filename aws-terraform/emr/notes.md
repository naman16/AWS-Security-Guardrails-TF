# AWS EMR Security Requirements Implementation Notes

1. emr:001: Enable EMR Account Public Access Block
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_emr_account_public_access_block` resource.

2. emr:002: Disable Public IP Addresses for EMR Cluster Instances
   - Implemented in Terraform code within the `aws_emr_cluster` resource by not specifying public IP addresses.

3. emr:003: Use Security Configuration for EMR Clusters
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_emr_security_configuration` resource.

4. emr:004: Restrict EMR Cluster Security Group Access
   - Partially implemented in Terraform code by using specific security groups for master and slave nodes. Additional configuration of these security groups is required outside this module.

5. emr:005: Configure Kerberos Authentication for EMR Clusters
   - Implemented in Terraform code within the `aws_emr_cluster` resource using the `kerberos_attributes` block.

6. emr:006: Enable At-Rest Encryption for EMR Cluster using AWS KMS
   - Implemented in Terraform code within the `aws_emr_security_configuration` resource.

7. emr:007: Enable Encryption of EBS Volumes for EMR Cluster
   - Implemented in Terraform code within the `aws_emr_security_configuration` resource.

8. emr:008: Enable In-Transit Encryption for EMR Cluster
   - Implemented in Terraform code within the `aws_emr_security_configuration` resource.

9. emr:009: Enable Local Disk Encryption for EMR Cluster
   - Implemented in Terraform code within the `aws_emr_security_configuration` resource.

10. emr:010: Use IAM Roles for EMR Cluster EC2 Instances
    - Implemented in Terraform code within the `aws_emr_cluster` resource by specifying the `instance_profile`.

11. emr:011: Enable EMR Cluster Logging
    - Implemented in Terraform code within the `aws_emr_cluster` resource by specifying the `log_uri`.

12. emr:012: Use VPC for EMR Cluster Deployment
    - Implemented in Terraform code within the `aws_emr_cluster` resource by specifying the `subnet_id`.

13. emr:013: Implement EMR Fine-Grained Access Control
    - Partially implemented in Terraform code using `aws_lakeformation_resource`. Additional Lake Formation permissions need to be set up outside this module.

14. emr:014: Enable EMR Step Execution Auditing
    - Not directly implemented in Terraform. This requires CloudTrail to be enabled, which is assumed to be configured at the account level.

15. emr:015: Use Latest EMR Release with Security Patches
    - Implemented in Terraform code within the `aws_emr_cluster` resource by specifying the `release_label`.

Additional security measures and best practices:
- All configurable parameters are exposed as variables to make the module reusable and flexible.
- The module uses secure options by default, such as enabling encryption and Kerberos authentication.
- The module assumes that KMS keys, VPC, subnets, security groups, and IAM roles already exist and requires their IDs/ARNs as input.
- Consider implementing additional access controls and monitoring for the EMR cluster and its associated resources.
- Implement least privilege access principles when defining IAM policies for cluster access.
- Regularly review and audit cluster configurations and access logs to ensure compliance with security requirements.
- Ensure that the S3 bucket used for cluster logging is properly secured with appropriate access controls and encryption.
- Consider using EMR on EKS or EMR Serverless for improved isolation and security in certain use cases.
