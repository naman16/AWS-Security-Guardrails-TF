# AWS API Gateway V2 Security Requirements Implementation Notes

1. apigatewayv2:001: Enable access logging for API Gateway V2
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_apigatewayv2_stage` resource with `access_log_settings` block.

2. apigatewayv2:002: Configure authorizers for API Gateway V2
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_apigatewayv2_authorizer` resource.

3. apigatewayv2:003: Specify authorization type for all API Gateway V2 routes
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_apigatewayv2_route` resource with `authorization_type` and `authorizer_id` attributes.

4. apigatewayv2:004: Enable encryption in transit for API Gateway V2
   - Implemented in Terraform code by setting `disable_execute_api_endpoint = true` in the `aws_apigatewayv2_api` resource to enforce HTTPS endpoints.

5. apigatewayv2:005: Implement throttling for API Gateway V2
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `route_settings` block in the `aws_apigatewayv2_stage` resource.

6. apigatewayv2:006: Enable AWS WAF for API Gateway V2
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_wafv2_web_acl_association` resource.

7. apigatewayv2:007: Implement API Gateway V2 usage plans and API keys
   - Partially implemented in Terraform code using `aws_apigatewayv2_api_key` resource. Usage plans are not directly supported in API Gateway V2, but can be managed through custom solutions.

8. apigatewayv2:008: Configure cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) for API Gateway V2
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `cors_configuration` block in the `aws_apigatewayv2_api` resource.

9. apigatewayv2:009: Enable detailed CloudWatch metrics for API Gateway V2
   - Implemented in Terraform code by setting `detailed_metrics_enabled = true` in the `default_route_settings` block of `aws_apigatewayv2_stage` resource.

10. apigatewayv2:010: Implement least privilege access for API Gateway V2
    - Not directly implemented in Terraform. This requires custom IAM policy implementation based on specific use cases.

11. apigatewayv2:011: Configure custom domain names with TLS certificates for API Gateway V2
    - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_apigatewayv2_domain_name` resource.

12. apigatewayv2:012: Implement request validation for API Gateway V2
    - Partially implemented in Terraform code using `aws_apigatewayv2_model` resource. Additional configuration may be required for specific routes.

13. apigatewayv2:013: Configure appropriate timeouts for API Gateway V2 integrations
    - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_apigatewayv2_integration` resource with `timeout_milliseconds` attribute.

14. apigatewayv2:014: Implement API caching for API Gateway V2
    - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_apigatewayv2_stage` resource with `cache_cluster_enabled` and `cache_cluster_size` attributes.

15. apigatewayv2:015: Configure stage variables for API Gateway V2
    - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_apigatewayv2_stage` resource with `stage_variables` attribute.

Additional security measures and best practices:
- All configurable parameters are exposed as variables to make the module reusable and flexible.
- The module uses the most secure options by default, such as enforcing HTTPS and implementing throttling.
- The module assumes that CloudWatch log groups, WAF Web ACLs, and ACM certificates already exist and requires their ARNs as input.
- Consider implementing additional access controls and monitoring for the API Gateway and its associated resources.
- Implement least privilege access principles when defining IAM policies for API access and management.
- Regularly review and audit API configurations, access logs, and metrics to ensure compliance with security requirements.
- Use API keys and usage plans to control and monitor API usage.
- Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms for API access.
- Regularly update and patch the API Gateway and associated services to address security vulnerabilities.
- Consider using VPC Links for private API integrations when applicable.
- Implement rate limiting and throttling to protect against DDoS attacks and excessive use.
