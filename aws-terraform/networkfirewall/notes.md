# AWS Network Firewall Security Requirements Implementation Notes

1. networkfirewall:001: Enable Logging for AWS Network Firewall
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_networkfirewall_logging_configuration` resource.

2. networkfirewall:002: Use AWS KMS Customer Managed Key for Network Firewall Encryption
   - Implemented in Terraform code within the `aws_networkfirewall_firewall`, `aws_networkfirewall_firewall_policy`, and `aws_networkfirewall_rule_group` resources using the `encryption_configuration` block.

3. networkfirewall:003: Enable Deletion Protection for AWS Network Firewall
   - Implemented in Terraform code within the `aws_networkfirewall_firewall` resource by setting `delete_protection = true`.

4. networkfirewall:004: Configure Stateful Inspection for AWS Network Firewall
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_networkfirewall_rule_group` resource with `type = "STATEFUL"`.

5. networkfirewall:005: Implement Strict Rule Actions in Network Firewall Policy
   - Implemented in Terraform code within the `aws_networkfirewall_firewall_policy` resource by setting strict default actions.

6. networkfirewall:006: Enable Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) in Network Firewall
   - Partially implemented in Terraform code using stateful rule groups. Full IPS capabilities may require additional configuration.

7. networkfirewall:007: Implement Domain Name Filtering in Network Firewall
   - Implemented in Terraform code within the stateful rule group using a sample rule to block a malicious domain.

8. networkfirewall:008: Enable TLS Inspection for Network Firewall
   - Not directly implemented in Terraform. This requires additional configuration and certificate management.

9. networkfirewall:009: Implement Centralized Network Firewall Management
   - Not implemented in Terraform. This requires AWS Firewall Manager, which is typically managed at the organization level.

10. networkfirewall:010: Configure Network Firewall High Availability
    - Implemented in Terraform code by allowing multiple subnet mappings in the `aws_networkfirewall_firewall` resource.

11. networkfirewall:011: Implement Least Privilege Access for Network Firewall Management
    - Implemented in Terraform code by creating separate IAM policies for read and write access to Network Firewall.

12. networkfirewall:012: Enable Continuous Monitoring of Network Firewall
    - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_cloudwatch_metric_alarm` resource to monitor dropped packets.

13. networkfirewall:013: Implement Regular Review and Update of Network Firewall Rules
    - Not directly implemented in Terraform. This is an operational process that should be established outside of infrastructure code.

14. networkfirewall:014: Configure Network Firewall to Block Known Malicious IP Addresses
    - Implemented in Terraform code within the stateful rule group using a sample rule to block specified IP ranges.

15. networkfirewall:015: Enable Logging of Dropped Traffic in Network Firewall
    - Implemented as part of networkfirewall:001 by configuring logging for both ALERT and FLOW logs.

Additional security measures and best practices:
- All configurable parameters are exposed as variables to make the module reusable and flexible.
- The module uses secure options by default, such as enabling deletion protection and encryption.
- The module assumes that KMS keys, log groups, and S3 buckets already exist and requires their IDs/ARNs as input.
- Consider implementing additional monitoring and alerting based on Network Firewall logs and metrics.
- Regularly review and update the firewall rules and policies to maintain an effective security posture.
- Implement proper network segmentation and use Network Firewall in conjunction with other AWS security services for a comprehensive security strategy.
