# AWS CloudFront Security Requirements Implementation Notes

1. cloudfront:001: Enforce HTTPS-only communication for CloudFront distributions
   - Implemented in Terraform code by setting `viewer_protocol_policy = "redirect-to-https"` in the default cache behavior.

2. cloudfront:002: Enable Server Name Indication (SNI) for CloudFront distributions
   - Implemented in Terraform code by setting `ssl_support_method = "sni-only"` in the viewer certificate configuration.

3. cloudfront:003: Ensure CloudFront distributions point to valid S3 origins
   - Implemented in Terraform code by configuring the origin with `domain_name` and `origin_id`. The actual S3 bucket validation should be done outside of this module.

4. cloudfront:004: Implement geo-restriction for CloudFront distributions
   - Implemented in Terraform code using the `restrictions` block with `geo_restriction` settings.

5. cloudfront:005: Configure origin failover for CloudFront distributions
   - Implemented in Terraform code using the `origin_group` configuration with primary and secondary origins.

6. cloudfront:006: Use Origin Access Control (OAC) for CloudFront distributions with S3 origins
   - Implemented in Terraform code by creating an `aws_cloudfront_origin_access_control` resource and associating it with the distribution.

7. cloudfront:007: Enable Field-Level Encryption for sensitive data in CloudFront distributions
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_cloudfront_field_level_encryption_config` and `aws_cloudfront_field_level_encryption_profile` resources.

8. cloudfront:008: Enable access logging for CloudFront distributions
   - Implemented in Terraform code using the `logging_config` block in the distribution resource.

9. cloudfront:009: Use latest TLS version for CloudFront viewer and origin connections
   - Implemented in Terraform code by setting `minimum_protocol_version = "TLSv1.2_2021"` in the viewer certificate configuration.

10. cloudfront:010: Configure default root object for CloudFront distributions
    - Implemented in Terraform code by setting `default_root_object` in the distribution resource.

11. cloudfront:011: Integrate AWS WAF with CloudFront distributions
    - Implemented in Terraform code by setting `web_acl_id` in the distribution resource.

12. cloudfront:012: Use custom SSL/TLS certificates for CloudFront distributions
    - Implemented in Terraform code by specifying `acm_certificate_arn` in the viewer certificate configuration.

13. cloudfront:013: Implement response headers policy for CloudFront distributions
    - Implemented in Terraform code by creating an `aws_cloudfront_response_headers_policy` resource and associating it with the distribution.

14. cloudfront:014: Enforce HTTPS for CloudFront origin protocol policy
    - Partially implemented. The current configuration assumes an S3 origin, which automatically uses HTTPS. For custom origins, additional configuration would be needed.

15. cloudfront:015: Implement standard encryption for real-time logs
    - Partially implemented by enabling real-time metrics subscription. However, the encryption of the Kinesis data stream is not handled in this module as it's typically managed separately.

Additional security measures and best practices:
- The module uses secure defaults, such as enabling IPv6, compression, and custom error responses.
- All configurable parameters are exposed as variables to make the module reusable and flexible.
- The module assumes that resources like S3 buckets, WAF WebACLs, and ACM certificates already exist and requires their IDs/ARNs as input.
- Consider implementing additional access controls and monitoring for the CloudFront distribution and its associated resources.
- Regularly review and audit CloudFront settings and access logs to ensure compliance with security requirements.
- Implement least privilege access principles when defining IAM policies for CloudFront and associated services.
- Regularly update the TLS version and security headers to align with the latest security best practices.
