# AWS VPC Security Requirements Implementation Notes

1. vpc:001: Configure VPC subnets to not assign public IP addresses by default
   - Implemented in Terraform code by setting `map_public_ip_on_launch = false` for private subnets.
   - For public subnets, this is configurable via a variable with a default of `false`.

2. vpc:002: Deploy VPC subnets across multiple Availability Zones
   - Implemented in Terraform code by creating subnets across multiple AZs using the `count` parameter and `availability_zones` variable.

3. vpc:003: Implement least privilege routing for VPC peering connections
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_vpc_peering_connection` and `aws_route` resources with specific route table IDs and destination CIDR blocks.

4. vpc:004: Ensure both VPN tunnels are active for AWS Site-to-Site VPN connections
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_vpn_connection` resource with two tunnel configurations.
   - Note: Actual tunnel status monitoring would require additional CloudWatch alarms or custom scripts.

5. vpc:005: Implement strict allow-listing for VPC endpoint service principals
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_vpc_endpoint_service_allowed_principal` resource.

6. vpc:006: Regularly review and audit VPC endpoint connections
   - Not directly implementable in Terraform. This requires operational processes and potentially custom scripts or third-party tools.

7. vpc:007: Deploy VPCs across multiple AWS regions
   - Not implemented in this module. This would typically be done by creating multiple instances of this module in different regions.

8. vpc:008: Configure VPC endpoints for Amazon EC2 service
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_vpc_endpoint` resource for EC2 service.

9. vpc:009: Implement manual acceptance for VPC Endpoint Service connections
   - Implemented in Terraform code by setting `acceptance_required = true` in the `aws_vpc_endpoint_service` resource.

10. vpc:010: Avoid provisioning default VPCs
    - Not directly implementable in Terraform for existing accounts. This is typically managed through AWS Organizations and SCPs.
    - For new accounts or regions, consider using `aws_default_vpc` resource with `force_destroy = true` to remove default VPCs.

11. vpc:011: Implement VPC flow logs for network traffic analysis
    - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_flow_log` resource.

12. vpc:012: Implement network segmentation using public and private subnets
    - Implemented in Terraform code by creating separate public and private subnet resources.

13. vpc:013: Use AWS Network Firewall for advanced traffic filtering
    - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_networkfirewall_firewall` resource.

14. vpc:014: Implement VPC peering encryption
    - Not directly configurable in Terraform. AWS automatically enables encryption for inter-region VPC peering connections.

15. vpc:015: Use VPC security groups for fine-grained access control
    - Partially implemented in Terraform code by configuring the default security group to be restrictive.
    - Note: Additional security groups should be created based on specific application needs.

Additional security measures and best practices:
- All configurable parameters are exposed as variables to make the module reusable and flexible.
- The module uses secure defaults where possible (e.g., private subnets don't assign public IPs by default).
- Consider implementing additional access controls and monitoring for VPC resources.
- Regularly review and audit VPC configurations, flow logs, and security group rules.
- Implement proper tagging strategy for better resource management and cost allocation.
- Consider using AWS Config rules to continuously monitor VPC configurations for compliance.
- Implement least privilege access principles when defining IAM policies for VPC management.
