# AWS OpenSearch Security Requirements Implementation Notes

1. opensearch:001: Enable Fine-Grained Access Control for OpenSearch Domains
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `advanced_security_options` block in `aws_opensearch_domain` resource.

2. opensearch:002: Enable Encryption at Rest for OpenSearch Domains using AWS KMS
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `encrypt_at_rest` block in `aws_opensearch_domain` resource.

3. opensearch:003: Enable Node-to-Node Encryption for OpenSearch Domains
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `node_to_node_encryption` block in `aws_opensearch_domain` resource.

4. opensearch:004: Enable HTTPS for OpenSearch Domain Endpoints
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `domain_endpoint_options` block in `aws_opensearch_domain` resource.

5. opensearch:005: Enable Audit Logging for OpenSearch Domains
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `log_publishing_options` block in `aws_opensearch_domain` resource for AUDIT_LOGS.

6. opensearch:006: Configure Three Dedicated Master Nodes for OpenSearch Domains
   - Implemented in Terraform code within the `cluster_config` block of `aws_opensearch_domain` resource.

7. opensearch:007: Enable Zone Awareness for OpenSearch Domains
   - Implemented in Terraform code within the `cluster_config` block of `aws_opensearch_domain` resource.

8. opensearch:008: Implement VPC-based Access Control for OpenSearch Domains
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `vpc_options` block in `aws_opensearch_domain` resource.

9. opensearch:009: Enable Automated Snapshots for OpenSearch Domains
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `snapshot_options` block in `aws_opensearch_domain` resource.

10. opensearch:010: Implement IP-based Access Control for OpenSearch Domains
    - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_opensearch_domain_policy` resource with IP-based conditions.

11. opensearch:011: Enable UltraWarm and Cold Storage for OpenSearch Domains
    - Implemented in Terraform code within the `cluster_config` block of `aws_opensearch_domain` resource.

12. opensearch:012: Implement Cross-Cluster Search for OpenSearch Domains
    - Partially implemented through the overall secure configuration. Specific cross-cluster search setup requires additional configuration based on use case.

13. opensearch:013: Enable Custom Endpoint for OpenSearch Domains
    - Implemented in Terraform code using `custom_endpoint` block in `aws_opensearch_domain` resource.

14. opensearch:014: Implement Least Privilege Access for OpenSearch Domains
    - Partially implemented by creating separate read and write IAM policies. Users should attach these policies to IAM roles/users as needed.

15. opensearch:015: Enable Slow Log Publishing for OpenSearch Domains
    - Implemented in Terraform code using `log_publishing_options` block in `aws_opensearch_domain` resource for SEARCH_SLOW_LOGS.

Additional security measures and best practices:
- All configurable parameters are exposed as variables to make the module reusable and flexible.
- The module uses secure defaults where possible, such as enforcing HTTPS and enabling encryption.
- The module assumes that KMS keys, VPC, subnets, security groups, and CloudWatch log groups already exist and requires their IDs/ARNs as input.
- Consider implementing additional monitoring and alerting for the OpenSearch domain using CloudWatch.
- Regularly review and update the allowed IP ranges in the domain policy.
- Implement proper secret management for the master user password.
- Consider using AWS Secrets Manager for managing OpenSearch credentials.
- Regularly update the OpenSearch version to the latest supported version for security patches.
- Implement regular security audits and penetration testing for the OpenSearch domain.
- Consider implementing a bastion host or AWS Systems Manager Session Manager for secure access to the OpenSearch domain.
