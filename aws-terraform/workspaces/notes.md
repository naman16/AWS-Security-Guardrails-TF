# AWS WorkSpaces Security Requirements Implementation Notes

1. workspaces:001: Use AWS KMS Customer Managed Key (CMK) for WorkSpaces Root Volume Encryption
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_workspaces_workspace` resource with `root_volume_encryption_enabled = true` and `volume_encryption_key` set to a KMS key.

2. workspaces:002: Use AWS KMS Customer Managed Key (CMK) for WorkSpaces User Volume Encryption
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_workspaces_workspace` resource with `user_volume_encryption_enabled = true` and `volume_encryption_key` set to a KMS key.

3. workspaces:003: Configure WorkSpaces to Use Private IP Addresses Only
   - Implemented in Terraform code by configuring `workspace_properties` within the `aws_workspaces_workspace` resource. The actual network configuration (VPC, subnets) should be managed separately.

4. workspaces:004: Implement Security Group Rules for WorkSpaces
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_security_group_rule` resource to allow inbound traffic on port 4172 (for WSP protocol).

5. workspaces:005: Enable Automatic Updates for WorkSpaces
   - Partially implemented in Terraform code by configuring `workspace_properties` within the `aws_workspaces_workspace` resource. The actual update mechanism is managed by AWS.

6. workspaces:006: Implement IP Access Control Groups for WorkSpaces
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_workspaces_ip_group` resource to define allowed IP ranges.

7. workspaces:007: Enable WorkSpaces Access Control Options
   - Partially implemented in Terraform code by configuring `workspace_properties` within the `aws_workspaces_workspace` resource. Some access controls are managed at the directory level.

8. workspaces:008: Implement Custom Images for WorkSpaces
   - Implemented in Terraform code by creating a separate `aws_workspaces_workspace` resource with a custom bundle ID.

9. workspaces:009: Enable Amazon WorkSpaces Streaming Protocol (WSP)
   - Implemented in Terraform code by setting `protocols = ["WSP"]` in the `workspace_properties` block of the `aws_workspaces_workspace` resource.

10. workspaces:010: Configure WorkSpaces Directory Settings for Enhanced Security
    - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_workspaces_directory` resource with various security settings.

11. workspaces:011: Implement Tagging for WorkSpaces Resources
    - Implemented in Terraform code by adding `tags` to all relevant resources.

12. workspaces:012: Enable WorkSpaces Maintenance Windows
    - Implemented in Terraform code by adding a `maintenance_mode` block to the `aws_workspaces_workspace` resource.

13. workspaces:013: Implement WorkSpaces Application Manager (WAM) for Application Control
    - Not directly implementable in Terraform. WAM is a separate service that needs to be configured outside of this module.

14. workspaces:014: Configure WorkSpaces to Use the Latest Operating System Versions
    - Not directly implementable in Terraform. This is managed through the WorkSpaces bundle and image selection, which should be regularly updated outside of this module.

15. workspaces:015: Implement Monitoring and Logging for WorkSpaces
    - Implemented in Terraform code by creating a CloudWatch log group and a metric alarm for unusual connection activity.

Additional security measures and best practices:
- All configurable parameters are exposed as variables to make the module reusable and flexible.
- The module uses secure defaults where possible, such as enabling encryption and restricting access.
- Consider implementing additional monitoring and alerting based on specific organizational requirements.
- Regularly review and update the WorkSpaces bundles and images to ensure they contain the latest security patches.
- Implement least privilege access principles when defining IAM policies for WorkSpaces management.
- Regularly audit WorkSpaces usage and access patterns to ensure compliance with security policies.
- Consider implementing additional network security measures such as VPC endpoints for WorkSpaces API access.
