# AWS MWAA Security Requirements Implementation Notes

1. mwaa:001: Enable Scheduler Logs for MWAA Environment
   - Implemented in Terraform code using the `logging_configuration` block in the `aws_mwaa_environment` resource.

2. mwaa:002: Enable Webserver Logs for MWAA Environment
   - Implemented in Terraform code using the `logging_configuration` block in the `aws_mwaa_environment` resource.

3. mwaa:003: Enable Worker Logs for MWAA Environment
   - Implemented in Terraform code using the `logging_configuration` block in the `aws_mwaa_environment` resource.

4. mwaa:004: Enforce Private Network Access for MWAA Environment
   - Implemented in Terraform code by setting `webserver_access_mode = "PRIVATE_ONLY"` in the `aws_mwaa_environment` resource.

5. mwaa:005: Use AWS KMS Customer Managed Key for MWAA Environment Encryption
   - Implemented in Terraform code by setting the `kms_key` attribute in the `aws_mwaa_environment` resource.

6. mwaa:006: Implement Least Privilege IAM Roles for MWAA Environment
   - Partially implemented in Terraform code by creating an IAM role with the AmazonMWAAExecutionRolePolicy. Additional custom policies may be required based on specific use cases.

7. mwaa:007: Enable MWAA Environment Monitoring with Amazon CloudWatch
   - Implemented in Terraform code through the `logging_configuration` block in the `aws_mwaa_environment` resource. CloudWatch is automatically integrated with MWAA.

8. mwaa:008: Implement Secure Network Configuration for MWAA Environment
   - Implemented in Terraform code using the `network_configuration` block in the `aws_mwaa_environment` resource.

9. mwaa:009: Enable Latest Apache Airflow Version for MWAA Environment
   - Implemented in Terraform code by setting the `airflow_version` attribute in the `aws_mwaa_environment` resource.

10. mwaa:010: Implement Secure Configuration for MWAA Environment S3 Bucket
    - Not directly implemented in this module. The S3 bucket should be configured separately with appropriate security settings.

11. mwaa:011: Enable MWAA Environment Tagging
    - Implemented in Terraform code by setting the `tags` attribute in the `aws_mwaa_environment` resource.

12. mwaa:012: Implement Secure Secrets Management for MWAA Environment
    - Partially implemented in Terraform code by creating an AWS Secrets Manager secret. Integration with MWAA requires additional configuration.

13. mwaa:013: Enable MWAA Environment Backup and Recovery
    - Not directly implemented in Terraform. This requires setting up additional backup and recovery processes outside of the MWAA environment configuration.

14. mwaa:014: Implement Secure DAG Deployment Process for MWAA Environment
    - Partially implemented in Terraform code by enabling versioning on the DAG S3 bucket. Additional processes for code review and authorized deployments should be implemented outside of Terraform.

15. mwaa:015: Enable MWAA Environment Integration with AWS WAF
    - Implemented in Terraform code using the `aws_wafv2_web_acl_association` resource.

Additional security measures and best practices:
- All configurable parameters are exposed as variables to make the module reusable and flexible.
- The module uses secure default values where possible, such as setting the webserver access mode to private only.
- Consider implementing additional access controls and monitoring for the MWAA environment and its associated resources.
- Implement least privilege access principles when defining IAM policies for MWAA execution roles.
- Regularly review and audit MWAA environment configurations and access logs to ensure compliance with security requirements.
- Ensure that the S3 buckets used for DAGs and logs are properly secured with appropriate encryption, access policies, and logging enabled.
- Implement a process for regular updates of the Airflow version to ensure the latest security patches are applied.
- Consider implementing network isolation using VPC endpoints for services that MWAA interacts with, such as S3 and Secrets Manager.
