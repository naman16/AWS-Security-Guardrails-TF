# AWS ElastiCache Security Requirements Implementation Notes

1. elasticache:001: Enable Automatic Failover for ElastiCache Redis Clusters
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `automatic_failover_enabled = true` in the `aws_elasticache_replication_group` resource.

2. elasticache:002: Use Private Subnets for ElastiCache Clusters
   - Implemented in Terraform code by creating a custom subnet group using `aws_elasticache_subnet_group` resource with private subnet IDs.

3. elasticache:003: Enable Automatic Backups for ElastiCache Redis Clusters
   - Implemented in Terraform code by setting `snapshot_retention_limit` and `snapshot_window` in the `aws_elasticache_replication_group` resource.

4. elasticache:004: Enable Multi-AZ for ElastiCache Redis Clusters
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `multi_az_enabled = true` in the `aws_elasticache_replication_group` resource.

5. elasticache:005: Enable In-Transit Encryption for ElastiCache Redis Clusters
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `transit_encryption_enabled = true` in the `aws_elasticache_replication_group` resource.

6. elasticache:006: Enable At-Rest Encryption for ElastiCache Redis Clusters
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `at_rest_encryption_enabled = true` and `kms_key_id` in the `aws_elasticache_replication_group` resource.

7. elasticache:007: Enable Redis AUTH for Older ElastiCache Redis Replication Groups
   - This is inherently implemented by setting `auth_token` in the `aws_elasticache_replication_group` resource, which applies to all versions.

8. elasticache:008: Enable Automatic Minor Version Upgrades for ElastiCache Redis Clusters
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `auto_minor_version_upgrade = true` in the `aws_elasticache_replication_group` resource.

9. elasticache:009: Use Custom Subnet Groups for ElastiCache Clusters
   - Implemented in Terraform code by creating a custom subnet group using `aws_elasticache_subnet_group` resource.

10. elasticache:010: Enable Auth Token for ElastiCache Redis Clusters
    - Implemented in Terraform code by setting `auth_token` in the `aws_elasticache_replication_group` resource.

11. elasticache:011: Use VPC Security Groups for ElastiCache Clusters
    - Implemented in Terraform code by setting `security_group_ids` in the `aws_elasticache_replication_group` resource.

12. elasticache:012: Implement Least Privilege Access for ElastiCache Clusters
    - Partially implemented by creating two IAM policies: one for read-only access and another for full access to ElastiCache. Users should attach these policies as needed to follow the principle of least privilege.

13. elasticache:013: Enable ElastiCache Cluster Monitoring
    - Implemented in Terraform code by creating a CloudWatch alarm using `aws_cloudwatch_metric_alarm` resource to monitor CPU utilization.

14. elasticache:014: Use Latest ElastiCache Engine Version
    - Implemented in Terraform code by setting `engine_version` to "6.x" by default, which will use the latest 6.x version. Users can override this if needed.

15. elasticache:015: Implement Regular Maintenance Windows for ElastiCache Clusters
    - Implemented in Terraform code by setting `maintenance_window` in the `aws_elasticache_replication_group` resource.

Additional security measures and best practices:
- All configurable parameters are exposed as variables to make the module reusable and flexible.
- The module uses secure options by default, such as enabling encryption, automatic failover, and multi-AZ deployment.
- The module assumes that KMS keys, VPC, subnets, security groups, and SNS topics already exist and requires their IDs/ARNs as input.
- Consider implementing additional monitoring and alerting based on other ElastiCache metrics.
- Regularly review and update the ElastiCache engine version to benefit from the latest security patches and features.
- Implement proper network segmentation and security group rules to restrict access to the ElastiCache cluster.
- Use AWS Secrets Manager or AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store to securely store and manage the auth token.
- Regularly rotate the auth token and update it in the ElastiCache cluster and in the applications that use it.
- Implement proper logging and auditing for all ElastiCache-related actions using AWS CloudTrail.
