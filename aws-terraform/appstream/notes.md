# AWS AppStream 2.0 Security Requirements Implementation Notes

1. appstream:001: Limit AppStream user maximum session duration to 10 hours
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `max_user_duration_in_seconds` in the `aws_appstream_fleet` resource.

2. appstream:002: Disable default Internet access for AppStream fleet streaming instances
   - Implemented in Terraform code by setting `enable_default_internet_access = false` in the `aws_appstream_fleet` resource.

3. appstream:003: Set AppStream session idle disconnect timeout to 10 minutes or less
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `idle_disconnect_timeout_in_seconds` in the `aws_appstream_fleet` resource.

4. appstream:004: Set AppStream session disconnect timeout to 5 minutes or less
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `disconnect_timeout_in_seconds` in the `aws_appstream_fleet` resource.

5. appstream:005: Enable encryption for AppStream 2.0 user sessions
   - Implemented in Terraform code by setting `stream_view = "ENCRYPTED"` in the `aws_appstream_fleet` resource.

6. appstream:006: Use AWS KMS Customer Managed Keys (CMK) for AppStream 2.0 encryption
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `stream_encryption_key_arn` in the `aws_appstream_fleet` resource.

7. appstream:007: Implement least privilege access for AppStream 2.0 fleet and stack management
   - Partially implemented by creating separate read-only and write IAM policies. Full implementation requires custom policies based on specific use cases.

8. appstream:008: Enable AppStream 2.0 usage reports
   - Implemented in Terraform code using the `aws_appstream_usage_report_subscription` resource.

9. appstream:009: Configure AppStream 2.0 to use latest streaming protocols
   - Implemented in Terraform code by setting `protocol = "TCP_UDP"` in the `aws_appstream_fleet` resource.

10. appstream:010: Implement network isolation for AppStream 2.0 fleets
    - Implemented in Terraform code using the `vpc_config` block in the `aws_appstream_fleet` resource.

11. appstream:011: Enable AppStream 2.0 user file persistence with encryption
    - Partially implemented in Terraform code using the `storage_connectors` block in the `aws_appstream_stack` resource. Encryption is handled by the S3 bucket configuration (not shown in this module).

12. appstream:012: Implement regular patching and updates for AppStream 2.0 images
    - Cannot be directly implemented in Terraform. This requires operational processes and potentially custom scripts or AWS Systems Manager.

13. appstream:013: Configure AppStream 2.0 to use SAML 2.0-based authentication
    - Implemented in Terraform code using the `user_settings` block in the `aws_appstream_stack` resource.

14. appstream:014: Enable AppStream 2.0 application entitlements
    - Partially implemented in Terraform code using the `aws_appstream_user_stack_association` resource. Full implementation requires additional configuration based on specific applications and user groups.

15. appstream:015: Implement AppStream 2.0 resource tagging for enhanced management and security
    - Implemented in Terraform code by adding `tags` to the `aws_appstream_fleet` and `aws_appstream_stack` resources.

Additional security measures and best practices:
- All configurable parameters are exposed as variables to make the module reusable and flexible.
- The module uses secure defaults where possible, such as disabling default internet access and enabling encryption.
- Consider implementing additional monitoring and alerting for AppStream 2.0 resources using CloudWatch.
- Regularly review and audit AppStream 2.0 configurations, usage reports, and access logs to ensure compliance with security requirements.
- Implement proper network segmentation and security group rules for AppStream 2.0 fleets.
- Ensure that the S3 buckets used for home folders and usage reports are properly secured and encrypted.
- Regularly update and patch AppStream 2.0 images to address security vulnerabilities.
- Use AWS Organizations and Service Control Policies (SCPs) to enforce AppStream 2.0 security policies across multiple accounts.
