# AWS Auto Scaling Group Security Requirements Implementation Notes

1. autoscaling:001: Use multiple instance types across multiple Availability Zones for EC2 Auto Scaling Groups
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_autoscaling_group` resource with `mixed_instances_policy` and `vpc_zone_identifier` for multiple AZs.

2. autoscaling:002: Enable Instance Metadata Service Version 2 (IMDSv2) for Auto Scaling group launch configurations
   - Implemented in Terraform code within the `aws_launch_template` resource using the `metadata_options` block.

3. autoscaling:003: Disable public IP address assignment for EC2 instances in Auto Scaling groups
   - Implemented in Terraform code within the `aws_launch_template` resource using the `network_interfaces` block.

4. autoscaling:004: Use Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) health checks for Auto Scaling groups
   - Implemented in Terraform code within the `aws_autoscaling_group` resource by setting `health_check_type = "ELB"`.

5. autoscaling:005: Use EC2 launch templates for Auto Scaling groups
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_launch_template` resource and referencing it in the `aws_autoscaling_group` resource.

6. autoscaling:006: Apply consistent tagging strategy for Auto Scaling groups and launched instances
   - Implemented in Terraform code by applying tags to both the `aws_launch_template` and `aws_autoscaling_group` resources.

7. autoscaling:007: Use VPC endpoints for AWS service access from Auto Scaling group instances
   - Not directly implemented in Terraform. This requires setting up VPC endpoints, which is typically done at the VPC level.

8. autoscaling:008: Implement instance refresh for Auto Scaling groups
   - Implemented in Terraform code within the `aws_autoscaling_group` resource using the `instance_refresh` block.

9. autoscaling:009: Enable detailed monitoring for Auto Scaling group instances
   - Implemented in Terraform code within the `aws_launch_template` resource by setting `monitoring { enabled = true }`.

10. autoscaling:010: Use AWS Systems Manager for instance management in Auto Scaling groups
    - Partially implemented by attaching an IAM instance profile for Systems Manager in the `aws_launch_template` resource.

11. autoscaling:011: Implement lifecycle hooks for Auto Scaling groups
    - Implemented in Terraform code within the `aws_autoscaling_group` resource using `initial_lifecycle_hook` blocks.

12. autoscaling:012: Use latest Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) for Auto Scaling group instances
    - Not directly implemented in Terraform. This requires a process to regularly update the AMI ID used in the launch template.

13. autoscaling:013: Implement appropriate termination policies for Auto Scaling groups
    - Implemented in Terraform code within the `aws_autoscaling_group` resource using the `termination_policies` attribute.

14. autoscaling:014: Use Auto Scaling group suspension processes judiciously
    - Not directly implemented in Terraform. This is an operational consideration rather than a configuration setting.

15. autoscaling:015: Implement appropriate scaling policies for Auto Scaling groups
    - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_autoscaling_policy` resources and associated CloudWatch alarms.

Additional security measures and best practices:
- The module uses the most secure options by default, such as requiring IMDSv2 and disabling public IP assignment.
- All configurable parameters are exposed as variables to make the module reusable and flexible.
- The module implements a mixed instances policy to support multiple instance types for cost optimization and availability.
- CloudWatch alarms are set up to trigger scaling actions based on CPU utilization.
- Consider implementing additional monitoring and alerting for the Auto Scaling group and its instances.
- Regularly review and update the AMI used in the launch template to ensure instances have the latest security patches.
- Implement least privilege access principles when defining IAM roles for instances and any associated resources.
- Consider implementing additional security group rules to restrict network access to and from the Auto Scaling group instances.
