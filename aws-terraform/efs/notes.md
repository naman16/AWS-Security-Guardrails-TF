# AWS EFS Security Requirements Implementation Notes

1. EFS:001: Restrict EFS mount targets to private subnets
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_efs_mount_target` resource with private subnet IDs.

2. EFS:002: Implement least privilege access for EFS file systems
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_efs_file_system_policy` resource with a restrictive policy.

3. EFS:003: Enable encryption at rest for EFS file systems using AWS KMS CMK
   - Implemented in Terraform code within the `aws_efs_file_system` resource using `encrypted = true` and `kms_key_id`.

4. EFS:004: Enforce user identity for EFS access points
   - Implemented in Terraform code within the `aws_efs_access_point` resource using the `posix_user` block.

5. EFS:005: Enable automatic backups for EFS file systems
   - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_efs_backup_policy` resource.

6. EFS:006: Enforce root directory for EFS access points
   - Implemented in Terraform code within the `aws_efs_access_point` resource using the `root_directory` block.

7. EFS:007: Enable encryption in transit for EFS file systems
   - Implemented in Terraform code by enforcing TLS in the file system policy.

8. EFS:008: Implement lifecycle management for EFS file systems
   - Implemented in Terraform code within the `aws_efs_file_system` resource using the `lifecycle_policy` block.

9. EFS:009: Enable performance mode and throughput mode for EFS file systems
   - Implemented in Terraform code within the `aws_efs_file_system` resource using `performance_mode` and `throughput_mode`.

10. EFS:010: Implement IAM authentication for EFS file systems
    - Implemented in Terraform code within the `aws_efs_file_system_policy` resource.

11. EFS:011: Configure EFS access points with creation info
    - Implemented in Terraform code within the `aws_efs_access_point` resource using the `creation_info` block.

12. EFS:012: Implement VPC security groups for EFS mount targets
    - Partially implemented in Terraform code by associating security groups with mount targets. Specific inbound rules should be configured in the referenced security group.

13. EFS:013: Enable EFS file system monitoring with Amazon CloudWatch
    - Implemented in Terraform code using `aws_cloudwatch_metric_alarm` resources for key metrics.

14. EFS:014: Implement cross-region backup for critical EFS file systems
    - Not directly implemented in Terraform. This requires additional configuration in AWS Backup, which is outside the scope of this EFS module.

15. EFS:015: Use EFS access points for application-specific entry points
    - Implemented in Terraform code using the `aws_efs_access_point` resource. Multiple access points can be created by duplicating this resource.

Additional security measures and best practices:
- All configurable parameters are exposed as variables to make the module reusable and flexible.
- The module uses secure default values where applicable.
- The module assumes that KMS keys, security groups, and SNS topics already exist and requires their IDs/ARNs as input.
- Consider implementing additional monitoring and alerting based on specific use cases and requirements.
- Regularly review and audit EFS policies and access patterns to ensure compliance with security requirements.
- Implement proper network segmentation and use Transit Gateway for hub-and-spoke architectures as mentioned in EFS:001, although this is typically done at the VPC level rather than within the EFS module.
